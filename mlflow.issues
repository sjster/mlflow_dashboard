For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution Fedora 35**:\r\n- **MLflow installed from binary**:\r\n- **MLflow version 1.23.1**:\r\n- **Python version Python 3.9.5**:\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nI have deployed the mlflow server on a remote host (gke) with the args --serve-artifacts. The pod has the access to read and write to google storage. When running the example code to test if the model file can be uploaded. It is logging metrics but failing to upload files when calling log_artifacts(\"outputs\").\r\n\r\nI was expecting artifacts to be uploaded to google cloud without credentials. Interesting thing is that my local system has access to the bucket too.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/examples/mlflow_artifacts/example.py\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\"ValueError: Anonymous credentials cannot be refreshed.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [*] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ *] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Thank you for submitting an issue. Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: macOS 11.6.3\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.23.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7.9\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `python xgb_metrics_bug.py`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nXGBoost comes with a few metrics with @ in their name, e.g. `ndcg@2`, see [XGBoost parameters](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parameter.html#learning-task-parameters). \r\n\r\nExpected behavior: MLflow should be able to autolog all built-in XGBoost metrics.\r\n\r\nActual behavior: when using a metric like this, the following warning is shown:\r\n\r\n> WARNING mlflow.utils.autologging_utils: Encountered unexpected error during xgboost autologging: Invalid metric name: 'train-ndcg@2'. Names may only contain alphanumerics, underscores (_), dashes (-), periods (.), spaces ( ), and slashes (/).\r\n\r\nbut not only this metric is discarded, instead autologging completely breaks, i.e. other metrics, the model artifact and the feature importance plot also are not recorded.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1640908/154653567-1de2e15b-9ad7-4f8b-a9fe-5a7808602916.png)\r\n\r\nI would propose to string-replace `@` with `_at_` in the XGBoost autologging metrics callback so that MLflow is compatible with all XGBoost built-in metrics.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\n`xgb_metrics_bug.py`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport xgboost as xgb\r\n\r\nmlflow.set_experiment(\"xgb_autolog_metrics_bug\")\r\n\r\nfor metrics in [[\"ndcg\"], [\"ndcg\", \"ndcg@2\"]]:\r\n    with mlflow.start_run():\r\n        mlflow.xgboost.autolog()\r\n\r\n        train_matrix = xgb.DMatrix(np.array([[0], [1]]), label=[1, 0])\r\n\r\n        params = {\r\n            \"objective\": \"rank:pairwise\",\r\n            \"eval_metric\": metrics,\r\n        }\r\n        xgb.train(params, train_matrix, evals=[(train_matrix, \"train\")])\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n- I tried this with xgboost versions 1.3.3 and 1.5.1\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n",

Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\n(In a few sentences, provide a clear, high-level description of the feature request)\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nTo be able to download time-series of metrics logged to mlflow as a csv. Whatever data can be visualized on the line plot in the mlflow experiment tracker Metrics pane will able to be download as csv for more detailed analysis or visualization. \r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nMetrics time series can be very useful for model selection and diagnosis. By viewing the time-corrected covariation between metrics, it will allow users to gain further insight into the model. Additionally, having a csv allows users flexibility to visualize and analyze these valuable metrics in whichever method they choose.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nGaining further insight into the model selection process. Additionally to help understand what metrics may be redundant or misleading.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nThe data is already stored somewhere in mlflow, but it is just not easily accessible to the user.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [X ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature. If you have a proposal for how to implement this feature, please include it here. For implementation guidelines, please refer to the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#contribution-guidelines).)\r\n\r\nJust make whatever data is used to create existing visualization available to the user for download. I think it would be a very small adjustment. ",

    "body": "## Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages new feature contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nFor cases where POST request latency is not the case or a custom inference logic is implemented, the default timeout (60s) of scoring server is not sufficient and a client asking for a response will lead to the following errors.\r\n```\r\nProtocolError: ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response'))\r\nConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response'))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? Timeout is hardcoded in scoring server. [link to code](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/pyfunc/scoring_server/__init__.py#L358)\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? We would probably wish to set a timeout for the scoring server\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? We have implemented a pyfunc model with custom inference logic and stateful model serving architecture. For applications where latency is not the case, it would be nice to opt for the desired scoring server timeout.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient) It's not implemented, though we have kept a fork MLFlow version and set a timeout argument to handle this case \r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [x] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [x] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nWe can probably \r\n1. create a new `--timeout` argument in `models serve` [command](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/models/cli.py#L35)\r\n2. remove the hardcoded timeout and create a new parser for timeout argument in scoring server [init](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/pyfunc/scoring_server/__init__.py#L358)",

    "body": "## Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages new feature contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nI apologise in advance as I am probably just using MLFlow wrong, so please educate me if there are better ways of achieving my goal :)\r\n\r\nMy goal is to register a Model with both Schema and custom Tags.\r\n\r\nI have been using `create_model_version` using the example from [here](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.tracking.html#mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient.create_model_version). The problem is I do not get the Schema even though I set signature in `mlflow.sklearn.log_model`.\r\n\r\nI am able to get the Schema set when I register the model using `mlflow.sklearn.log_model` by setting `registered_model_name`, however then I cannot find an elegant way of setting the tags.\r\nWhen running log_model it prints the resulting version number, but it does not return it in the modelInfo object, so I cannot find an elegant solution to how to set the tags afterwards using `set_model_version_tag`, I currently use `get_registered_model` and just assume the latest is the one I just registered.\r\n\r\nIf this is just not me using MLFlow wrong I believe this can be solved in two ways:\r\n- tags added as a parameter to all log_model functions\r\n- registered_model_version returned as part of ModelInfo when setting `registered_model_name` in `log_model`\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nAbility to elegantly both set both Schema and tags on a registered model\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.

I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Microsoft Windows 10 Home Version 21H2\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.23.1\r\n- **Python version**: 3.9.4\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: see below\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nCalling mlflow.sklearn.log_model function raises `TypeError: expected string or bytes-like object`.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow\r\nmlflow.set_tracking_uri(MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI)\r\nmlflow.set_experiment(MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT)\r\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\r\nfrom sklearn import tree\r\niris = load_iris()\r\nsk_model = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()\r\nsk_model = sk_model.fit(iris.data, iris.target)\r\nmlflow.sklearn.log_model(sk_model, str(\"sk_models\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nThis seems to be due to `importlib_metadata.version` function, which tries to get the installed version of scikit-learn, but it returns None. I have installed scikit-learn 1.0.2 through `pip install scikit-learn`, and the following code correctly prints 1.0.2:\r\n```\r\nimport sklearn\r\nprint(sklearn.__version__)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [X] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n",

I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: no\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Microsoft Windows 10 Version 20H2\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.22.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8.5\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: 7.11.0\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \"mlflow ui\" -> navigate to an experiment with over 100 run results\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nMLFlow UI only displays 100 run results for 100+ run experiments. Clicking \"Load more\" in the UI loads additional runs. However, those additional runs immediately disappear as soon as you try to sort by a column in the table, thus defeating the point of loading more results into the table. \r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n",

    "body": "## Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages new feature contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n`CreateExperiments` permits attaching tags to an experiment.  But I can't find a way to filter experiments using those tags:\r\n- `ListExperiments` has no parameters for filtering\r\n- there isn't a `SearchExperiments` endpoint\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?  I want to be able to organize experiments from different users and organizations.  Tags are often promising, but without a way to retrieve experiments based on tags, I don't see a way to use them.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?  I'm probably not the only person who'd like to enable different users and organizations to be able to filter the experiments.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?  Different users may share the same MLflow installation, and want to look at their own experiments.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient) Not sure how to answer this: it's not implemented, so it's hard to do :)  Client side filtering of the API responses is possible so long as the number of experiments and users are small.  But as those grow over time, I expect it to be unwieldy and slow.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [X] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nCurrently, I'm focused only on the API - there's some new UI possibility here, but I'm going to ignore those issues for now.\r\n\r\nTwo approaches occur to me.\r\n\r\n### `SearchExperiments`\r\n\r\n`SearchExperiments` could be added, by analogy with e.g. `SearchRuns`.  This would involve implementing the search functionality at [1] for experiments.  This way, experiment search has a similar developer experience to other search endpoints.\r\n\r\nThis would allow callers to get a filtered list by tag using an expression like: `tags.<key> = <value>`.  Since the search syntax already supports boolean combinations, it'd be easy to implement a filtered view of experiments.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- suffices for my use-case\r\n- extends existing search features\r\n- the `Search...` endpoints use `POST`, so no encoding is needed\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- more powerful than I need\r\n- some preferences exist against this design, e.g. [2]\r\n\r\n### `ListExperiments`\r\n\r\n`ListExperiments` could be extended with a `tags` parameter that accepts a (default empty) list of key-value pairs.  Those pair would *all* be applied as filters on the sqlalchemy query.\r\n\r\nThis would allow callers to get a filtered list by using an argument like `[<key>=<value>]`.  Since filtering by multiple tags is often useful, this should be a list so no expression parsing is required.  Each key-value pair would translate to a sqlalchemy filter on the underlying query.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- suffices for my use-case\r\n- simpler interface and probably implementation\r\n- searching by tag conjunction is a common paradigm\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- `ListExpressions` uses GET, so the key value pairs need to be url-encoded\r\n- different developer experience when filtering experiments vs e.g. runs\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] - https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/search-syntax.html\r\n[2] - https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/3881#issuecomment-754053632\r\n",

Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, the required entry script for deployment of models onto the `azureml` ecosystem from `mlflow` is hardwired as a text string, and configurable using the `mlflow.pyfunc` functions for each model flavour. However, the current function to decoding JSON input data only supports Schema types associated with Pandas Dataframe tabular data, and does not for example, support the use **TFServing type tensor structures** which are important for image based applications.\r\n\r\nThe current string which is hard coded into the `mlflow.azureml.__init__.py` file is as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom azureml.core.model import Model\r\nfrom mlflow.pyfunc import load_model\r\nfrom mlflow.pyfunc.scoring_server import parse_json_input, _get_jsonable_obj\r\n\r\ndef init():\r\n    global model\r\n    model_path = Model.get_model_path(model_name=\"{model_name}\", version={model_version})\r\n    model = load_model(model_path)\r\n\r\ndef run(json_input):\r\n    input_df = parse_json_input(json_input=json_input, orient=\"split\")\r\n    return _get_jsonable_obj(model.predict(input_df), pandas_orient=\"records\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe [`parse_json_input`](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/1335164d20a6521dd4ebfe3f361d19fe9672efcf/mlflow/pyfunc/scoring_server/__init__.py#L116) function, which comes form the module `mlflow.pyfunc.scoring_server`, has only the ability to handle Pandas Dataframe tabular data, and thus does not convert input JSON content to tensor (numpy ndarray) type objects. It doesn't support the TFServing tensor format, which would allow for decoding of these types of structures.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nA simple extension of a use case here is the ability to tensor type inputs as defined by the Tensorspec Schema type, and support the deserialization of numpy ndarrays, such as images. This opens up the potential for any type of application which uses ndarray objects as inputs, such as CNN applications.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\nIt broadens the scope of the types of models that can be deployed on AzureML using the model agnostic infrastructure developed through the `mlflow.pyfunc` flavours.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\nPotential for many different types of models, not just Pandas dataframe tabular based data structures as input.\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of the entry script is defined as a hard coded string in the `mlflow.azureml` module and cannot be overwritten or modified by any functional call. Therefore, the limitations of what data types can be deserialized by the JSON deserialization function used cannot be circumvented without changes to the said the module.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [x] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [x] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature. If you have a proposal for how to implement this feature, please include it here. For implementation guidelines, please refer to the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#contribution-guidelines).)\r\n\r\nOne potential solution to the problem is to use existing functionality that has been developed for other deployment types in the `mlflow` package. A number of JSON deserialization functions are contained within the `mlflow.pyfunc.scoring_serving` module which do have the ability to decode TFServing type tensor formats, and convert these to numpy ndarrays from the specified `mlflow.types.Schema`.\r\n\r\nIf an input of a numpy ndarray representing an image (e.g. shape of `image` is `(3,800,600)` array) is encapsulated and serialized in the following way (using the TFServing definintion):\r\n\r\n```python\r\npayload = {\r\n            'instances' : [\r\n                image.tolist()\r\n                ]\r\n        }\r\npayload = str.encode(json.dumps(payload)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen using the `mlflow.pyfunc.scoring_server` module function [`infer_and_parse_json_input()`](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/1335164d20a6521dd4ebfe3f361d19fe9672efcf/mlflow/pyfunc/scoring_server/__init__.py#L76) in the entry script does result in successful decoding of the above JSON serialized numpy ndarray back to the correct sized object, which can then be passed to loaded model function for inference.\r\n\r\nA notional modification to the entry script could potentially be as simple as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom azureml.core.model import Model\r\nfrom mlflow.pyfunc import load_model\r\nfrom mlflow.pyfunc.scoring_server import infer_and_parse_json_input, _get_jsonable_obj\r\n\r\ndef init():\r\n    global model\r\n    model_path = Model.get_model_path(model_name=\"{model_name}\", version={model_version})\r\n    model = load_model(model_path)\r\n\r\ndef run(json_input):\r\n    input = infer_and_parse_json_input(json_input=json_input, orient=\"split\")\r\n    return _get_jsonable_obj(model.predict(input), pandas_orient=\"records\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nLocal testing of this functionality appears to be successful in decoding the JSON serialized image back to a `numpy ndarray` and was successfully accepted by a `PyTorch ONNX` model that takes `numpy ndarray` image representations as input.\r\n\r\nThere are a few issues to iron out, including the additional dimension returned by the `infer_and_parse_json_input()` function, that is a shape of `(1,3,nx,ny)` instead of the transmitted `(3,nx,ny)`. A simple `numpy.squeeze()` application solves this issue, however, `input` may not be only be a `numpy ndarray` so some digging into the `infer_and_parse_json_input()` function is required to see why.\r\n",

Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nParallelize the download of artifact files from ModelsArtifactRepository.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nModelsArtifactRepository.download_artifacts() currently access files in a single-threaded way.  For models with only a few artifacts, this is ok, however there are models out there with a great number of files.  This causes the initial download of the model to take much longer than it ideally should.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\nFaster download times for large models.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\nIf our customer can download their large models faster, it will allow them to train/develop models faster and distribute them to a wider user base.\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\nThe existing MLFlow implementation currently doesn't parallelize these operations, causing the file I/O to become a bottleneck.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature. If you have a proposal for how to implement this feature, please include it here. For implementation guidelines, please refer to the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#contribution-guidelines).)\r\n",

For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: yes -- custom Pyfunc model\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux Ubuntu 18.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.22.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.9\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nI am running an evaluation of my model using `mlflow.evaluate` function. Here is the command used:\r\n```\r\nmlflow.evaluate(\r\n    model=model,  # custom pyfunc model\r\n    data=data.head(), # pandas dataframe\r\n    targets=\"label\",\r\n    model_type=\"classifier\",\r\n    dataset_name=\"test\",\r\n    dataset_path=args.data_uri,\r\n    evaluators=[\"default\"],\r\n)\r\n```\r\nAnd I run on the following error:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"evaluate.py\", line 42, in <module>\r\n    feature_names=[\"text\"]\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/models/evaluation/base.py\", line 807, in evaluate\r\n    feature_names=feature_names,\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mlflow/models/evaluation/base.py\", line 317, in __init__\r\n    if isinstance(data, spark_df_type):\r\nTypeError: isinstance() arg 2 must be a type or tuple of types\r\n```\r\nThe origin of this error seems to come from this part of the code in https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/models/evaluation/base.py in `EvaluationDataset`:\r\n```\r\nif \"pyspark\" in sys.modules:\r\n    from pyspark.sql import DataFrame as SparkDataFrame\r\n\r\n    supported_dataframe_types = (pd.DataFrame, SparkDataFrame)\r\n    spark_df_type = SparkDataFrame\r\nelse:\r\n    supported_dataframe_types = (pd.DataFrame,)\r\n    spark_df_type = None\r\n```\r\nSo if pyspark is not installed in your modules it will throw the above error because `spark_df_type` is `None`. I believe that pyspark should not be a requirement here and that we should have a check before running `isinstance(data, spark_df_type)`\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [x] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n",

Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [X] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nRequest improvement to log-scale labels within metric plots by converting to standard scientific notation.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\n- Interactive plotting of machine learning runs. Improvement obviates need for UI's like Tensorboard.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n- Enhances dynamic analysis of metrics.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n- Helps keep my sanity and better conveys plot information\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n- Do not expect this fix to be difficult. However, personally unable to determine where plot labels are generated in source files. Not fluent in JS. \r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [X] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nAt present, it is difficult to read plots that are log-scaled due to the chosen formatting of text units (e.g. \\mu for micro 10^-6). This request is to convert log scaling according to standard convention (e.g. 4e-3) as more commonly found in plotting applications such Tensorboard.

    "body": "Thank you for submitting a feature request. **Before proceeding, please review MLflow's [Issue Policy for feature requests](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md#feature-requests) and the [MLflow Contributing Guide](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)**.\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this feature request template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\nCurrently, the method `client.set_model_version_tag` only accepts an integer value for the parameter `version`. However, downstream jobs that refer to a model in the model registry often refer to it by `stage` instead of `version`. It would simplify things if the `set_model_version_tag` method would accept the stage name in addition to the version as well.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nclient.set_model_version_tag(name=\"my-model\", version=\"staging\", key=\"mykey\", value=\"myvalue\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, if someone now wants to set a tag for a `production` model, the person would first have to look up the `model version` for that model before it can set the tag. \r\n\r\n## Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages new feature contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nAllow `client.set_model_version_tag` to accept `staging,production,archived` as values for the `version` parameter as well, or add an additional parameter called `stage` that can be used instead of `version`.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? _It makes MLflow simpler to use_\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [x] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.

Use the `mlflow_artifacts` example, so command is `python example.py`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nI expect to be able to save artifacts from the `mlflow_artifacts` example to the server running on a separate machine. Instead I get errors relating to the URI. \r\n\r\nOnly running the example code from the same machine works. \r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\nOn an ubuntu machine, run the server command:\r\n```bash\r\nmlflow server  --serve-artifacts --host 0.0.0.0 -p 5020    --artifacts-destination ./mlartifacts     --gunicorn-opts \"--log-level debug\"\r\n```\r\n(Note that adding the option `--default-artifact-root http://<server-ip>:5020/api/2.0/mlflow-artifacts/artifacts/experiments` doesn't change a thing)\r\n\r\nOn a windows machine:\r\n```powershell\r\n$env:MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=\"http://<ip-of-server>:5020/\"\r\ncd examples/mlflow_artifacts/\r\npython example.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is the following error:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='0.0.0.0', port=5020): Max retries exceeded with url: /api/2.0/mlflow-artifacts/artifacts/experiments/0/ef5c9d97f4504cc494413c4d5cf048f7/artifacts/a.txt (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x000002464D5AC700>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10049] The requested address is not valid in its context'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the hint is in the HTTPConnectionPool, which seems to be looking for a localhost (0.0.0.0) rather than the server name. Since this is being passed to the client on a different machine, which isn't running a server, the client can't save the artifact. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nOSError                                   Traceback (most recent call last)\r\nFile ~\\Miniconda3\\envs\\mlflow\\lib\\site-packages\\urllib3\\connection.py:174, in HTTPConnection._new_conn(self)\r\n    173 try:\r\n--> 174     conn = connection.create_connection(\r\n    175         (self._dns_host, self.port), self.timeout, **extra_kw\r\n    176     )\r\n    178 except SocketTimeout:\r\n\r\nFile ~\\Miniconda3\\envs\\mlflow\\lib\\site-packages\\urllib3\\util\\connection.py:96, in create_connection(address, timeout, source_address, socket_options)\r\n     95 if err is not None:\r\n---> 96     raise err\r\n     98 raise socket.error(\"getaddrinfo returns an empty list\")\r\n\r\nFile ~\\Miniconda3\\envs\\mlflow\\lib\\site-packages\\urllib3\\util\\connection.py:86, in create_connection(address, timeout, source_address, socket_options)\r\n     85     sock.bind(source_address)\r\n---> 86 sock.connect(sa)\r\n     87 return sock\r\n\r\nOSError: [WinError 10049] The requested address is not valid in its context\r\n\r\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\n\r\nNewConnectionError                        Traceback (most recent call last)\r\nFile ~\\Miniconda3\\envs\\mlflow\\lib\\site-packages\\urllib3\\connectionpool.py:699, in HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen(self, method, url, body, headers, retries, redirect, assert_same_host, timeout, pool_timeout, release_conn, chunked, body_pos, **response_kw)\r\n    698 # Make the request on the httplib connection object.\r\n--> 699 httplib_response = self._make_request(\r\n    700     conn,\r\n    701     method,\r\n    702     url,\r\n    703     timeout=timeout_obj,\r\n    704     body=body,\r\n    705     headers=headers,\r\n    706     chunked=chunked,\r\n    707 )\r\n    709 # If we're going to release the connection in ``finally:``, then\r\n    710 # the response doesn't need to know about the connection.

    "body": "## Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages new feature contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nIn the mlflow package, implemnt a `log_array_metric(name, array)` function. It will be equivalent to:\r\n```\r\nfor i, val in enumerate(array):\r\n     mlflow.log_metric(name, val, step=i) \r\n```\r\nThe implementation should rely on the log_batch function of MlflowClient object in order to reduce the number of calls to the mlflow server\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nIt is a common use case to log a loss after a training. Currently, it is necessary to write the loop. This FR would remove some boiler plate code.\r\nThe loop generates N remote calls to the mlflow server (N = size of the array). For my personal use-case, logging 1000 points takes 90 s. If I use log_batch method from the mflowclient, it takes 4s.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.

Calling the model as a function directly is orders of magnitude faster and still works on batches of inputs.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n```python\r\nimport sklearn.datasets as datasets\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\r\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense\r\nfrom tensorflow.keras.optimizers import SGD\r\n\r\n\r\niris = datasets.load_iris()\r\ndata = pd.DataFrame(\r\n    data=np.c_[iris[\"data\"], iris[\"target\"]], columns=iris[\"feature_names\"] + [\"target\"]\r\n)\r\ny = data[\"target\"]\r\nx = data.drop(\"target\", axis=1)\r\n\r\nmodel = Sequential()\r\nmodel.add(Dense(3, input_dim=4))\r\nmodel.add(Dense(1))\r\nmodel.compile(loss=\"mean_squared_error\", optimizer=SGD())\r\nmodel.fit(x.values, y.values)\r\nmlflow.keras.save_model(model, \"keras_model\")\r\n\r\nmodel_loaded = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(\"keras_model\")\r\n\r\n# call keras.Model predict method\r\n# %timeit model_loaded._model_impl.keras_model.predict(x.values)\r\n# 30.1 ms ± 4.37 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)\r\n\r\n# call keras.Model as function\r\n# %timeit model_loaded._model_impl.keras_model(x.values)\r\n# 556 µs ± 13.3 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)\r\n\r\n# assert parity between calling methods\r\n# np.allclose(model_loaded._model_impl.keras_model.predict(x.values), model_loaded._model_impl.keras_model(x.values))\r\n# True\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't think this makes a difference in TensorFlow <2.0 since the graph is executed correctly, but in >=2.0, a large amount of setup happens under-the-hood when calling `keras.Model.predict` leading to the slowdown observed here.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations",

Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, if you would want to make predictions with your model as UDF, only a double, array of doubles, or array of strings is supported. My proposal would be to extend the model output format to more complex output structures, which can be defined using a Spark schema or using the mlflow output signature.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nMaking model predictions when you have loaded your model as UDF.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nFor example, a model output of `[0.8, 0.9, 2012]`, is much less robust and less flexible than a model output of `{'extracted_x': 2012, 'probabilities': {'label_x': 0.8, 'label_y': 0.9}]`.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.

    "body": "## Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages new feature contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nAdding an `--include-all` flag to the `mlflow artifacts download` command would facilitate more flexible use MLFlow in CI/CD flows by linking relative model paths to run artifacts directly. \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\n  ML teams orchestrate regular retraining runs in a workflow manager. When adopting MLFlow for tracking these runs, there is a ton of flexibility for workable promotion processes that MLFlow's ModelRegistry and tagging system can facilitate.  \r\n  \r\n  For example, when running CI on a staging branch, we can include a make command that calls `mlflow artifacts download --artifact-uri models:/my_model/Staging --include-all` to grab any artifacts required for serving, testing, or reporting. \r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\n    It makes integrating the ModelRegistry with automated testing easier. \r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\n    It makes integrating the ModelRegistry with automated testing easier. \r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\n    Rather than being a component of the CLI, we write a script. While this is not difficult, having this feature in the CLI would better enable model testing.\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nfrom mlflow.store.artifact.models_artifact_repo import ModelsArtifactRepository\r\n\r\nmodel_uri = \"models:/my_model/Production\"\r\nmodel_path = ModelsArtifactRepository.get_underlying_uri(model_uri)\r\nartifacts_path = model_path.strip('/model')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThe `ArtifactRepositoryRegistry` interface is great and I wouldn't want to modify it for this small quality-of-life improvement. It would muddy the distinction between a `RunsArtifactRepository` and a `ModelsArtifactRepository`. \r\n\r\nOne implementation path would look like the following:\r\n\r\n**1.  Add the `include-all` flag to the `mlflow artifacts download` command**\r\n```Python\r\n@commands.command(\"download\")\r\n@click.option(\"--run-id\", \"-r\", help=\"Run ID from which to download\")\r\n@click.option(\r\n    \"--artifact-path\",\r\n    \"-a\",\r\n    help=\"For use with Run ID: if specified, a path relative to the run's root \"\r\n    \"directory to download\",\r\n)\r\n@click.option(\r\n    \"--artifact-uri\",\r\n    \"-u\",\r\n    help=\"URI pointing to the artifact file or artifacts directory; use as an \"\r\n    \"alternative to specifying --run_id and --artifact-path\",\r\n)\r\n@click.option(\"--include-all/--no-include-all\", default=False)\r\ndef download_artifacts(run_id, artifact_path, artifact_uri, include_all):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Download an artifact file or directory to a local directory.\r\n    The output is the name of the file or directory on the local disk.\r\n\r\n    The ``include-all`` flag allows users to pull all artifacts from a\r\n    run using a relative model uri like models:/<model>/Staging\r\n\r\n    Either ``--run-id`` or ``--artifact-uri`` must be provided.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    if run_id is None and artifact_uri is None:\r\n        _logger.error(\"Either ``--run-id`` or ``--artifact-uri`` must be provided.\")\r\n        sys.exit(1)\r\n\r\n    if run_id is not None and not include_all:\r\n        _logger.error(\"The ``-no-include-all`` flag only works with ``--artifact-uri``\")\r\n        sys.exit(1)\r\n\r\n    if artifact_uri is not None:\r\n        print(_download_artifact_from_uri(artifact_uri, include_all=include_all))\r\n        return\r\n\r\n    artifact_path = artifact_path if artifact_path is not None else \"\"\r\n    store = _get_store()\r\n    artifact_uri = store.get_run(run_id).info.artifact_uri\r\n    artifact_repo = get_artifact_repository(artifact_uri)\r\n    artifact_location = artifact_repo.download_artifacts(artifact_path)\r\n    print(artifact_location)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**2.

    "body": "## Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages new feature contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [X] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nThe browser overview of a single run comes with the displayal of artifcats - one of them being the 'model' artifact. Conveniently, this also comes with code snippets on how to use the model at hand for predictions. As of now, these code snippets [seem hard to adapt](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/server/js/src/experiment-tracking/components/artifact-view-components/ShowArtifactLoggedModelView.js#L90-L121). For some users, the currently generated code snippets are not applicable and it would be desirable to change the snippets to custom code.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nA priori, a user will believe the code snippets to be correct and applicable - in some scenarios, e.g. when there are further dependencies for prediction such as a chaining of models, it doesn't. In these cases, it would be desirable to overwrite the generated code snippets. Moreover, other aspects, such as data loading, could be included if desired.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nBeing able to customize these snippets could e.g. also allow to allow for some lines on data loading to be included. This, in turn, would make the snippets more complete and valuable.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nFor new team members especially, it can be quite confusing to display and advertise code snippets which are not applicable for the setup at hand since the mistake is easily assumed to lie on the user end. Independently of that, it seems undesirable to suggest approaches which are not applicable or simply 'don't work' due to particularities of the use case.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nMy understanding is that these code snippets are more or less hardcoded in javascript on the server side and not able to be defined via the python interface on the client side. See https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/server/js/src/experiment-tracking/components/artifact-view-components/ShowArtifactLoggedModelView.js#L90-L121\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [X] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [X] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThe section at hand can be seen in the screenshot below:\r\n![Screenshot 2022-01-07 095232](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43778085/148520178-8fd8c275-c2e6-460e-baf7-e0187148bc11.png)\r\n\r\n",

Here are several important points which are related to this:\r\n- In this context, each model service components are a completely different service. They aren't replicas.\r\n- The VPC in yellow are the user artefacts, while the purple ones are managed by the our team.\r\n- MLFlow service is exposed through a public API that is only accessible by other internal services. We use openresty as the proxy.\r\n- Google Cloud Storage (GCS) doesn't lie inside the VPC. It's accessible through the internet. But, it's protected by a perimeter.\r\n\r\nNext, let's zoom into the main use case of this system, which is to fetch models from the MLFlow service.\r\n![mlflow-deployment (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32842826/148485032-145eca4d-c719-4adf-ace9-2a3d210b1d5e.png)\r\nthe picture above shows the flow of the main use case of this system. The flow happens sequentially, but each request can be parallelized. Here is the detail of the flow:\r\n1.  MLFlow returns the GCS URL of the model, not the model itself.\r\n2.  Next, the model service requests the file to the GCS.\r\n3. GCS returns the requested files.\r\n\r\nyou can see the problem lies when the users need to get the model file directly to GCS. they can't do that due to the perimeter.\r\n",

You can check out our blog post about it: [Stay Ahead of Breaking Changes with the New Lightning Ecosystem CI](https://devblog.pytorchlightning.ai/stay-ahead-of-breaking-changes-with-the-new-lightning-ecosystem-ci-b7e1cf78a6c7) :zap: \r\nWe already have joined integration between PL and your logger, so we would like to level it up. At this moment, we are running tests with your latest version, but it may accidentally happen that your next version will be incompatible with our next release version... :confused:  But here we have a solution - ecosystem CI with testing both - your and our latest development head we can find it very early and prevent releasing eventually bad version... :+1: \r\n\r\n### What is needed to do?\r\n- have some tests, including PL integration\r\n- add config to ecosystem CI - https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/ecosystem-ci\r\n\r\n### What will you get?\r\n- scheduled nightly testing configured development/stable heads\r\n- slack notification if something went wrong\r\n- testing also on multi-GPU machine",

Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nAdd versioning of MLroject file specification and add support to mlflow working with different versions of MLproject file. \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nToday mlflow uses single file format. In this approach, it is necessary to maintain backward compatibility when adding a new feature. For example, there is feature request #4246 (adding poetry to create environment). To implement it we need to add another if condition to [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/projects/_project_spec.py#L38)\r\n```python\r\n    docker_env = yaml_obj.get(\"docker_env\")\r\n    if docker_env:\r\n   ...\r\n    # Validate config if conda_env parameter is present\r\n    conda_path = yaml_obj.get(\"conda_env\")\r\n    if conda_path and docker_env:\r\n        raise ExecutionException(\"Project cannot contain both a docker and \" \"conda environment.\")\r\n```\r\nThat approach will look not great and in my opinion it better to add environment field to MLproject file, something like this\r\n```yaml\r\nenv:\r\n  type: docker\r\n  image: python:3.7\r\n```\r\nor \r\n```yaml\r\nenv:\r\n  type: conda\r\n  file: conda.yaml\r\n```\r\nThis type of change will break backaward compability. To get good user experience of using projects explicit information about used version of the file should be given.\r\n\r\nThus, proposal will next: add version field to MLproject file and add mlflow support of using different version of MLproject file specification. For example, like it uses in [docker compose file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) and [kubernetes apiVersion field](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/).  \r\nTo save backaward campability of current version it posible to maintain current functionality without  adding version field in file. To use new functionality user have to add version field to MLproject file.\r\n\r\nFiles in package projects will be affected (I can add more details if needed).  \r\n\r\nNext pros and cons \r\nPros:\r\n- possibility to break backward compatibility and add new features with less effort\r\n- explicit information which functionality is available for installed version of mlflow\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- user should know version of MLproject file specification (using of major+minor versioning with compatibility for major version can help to reduce this problem).\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [x] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.

I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nCurrently, MLFlow's spark flavor only support saving/logging classes that are `Models`, and it means even those popular `Transformers` like `Bucketizer` can't call save/log/predict. Could you support `Transformers` since both of them belong to `Pipeline` and it makes more sense if we can just call the same behavior for models and transformers.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nSave, log and inference with spark transformers.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nMLFlow spark already support `models`, and transformers are just like models that can be put into pipelines.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nIt makes models and transformers behaviors consistent, and users can keep track of them using mlflow following the same pattern.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nMlflow spark currently has a strict check that only classes of type `pyspark.ml.model` can be passed to the following save_model function, so for transformers we must wrap it as pipeline model in order to save it, which makes the process more complicated. So if you could add transformers into the `_validate_model` function then it can directly be saved by mlflow.spark.save_model.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.

I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nThe requested feature will allow users of mlflow (directly or e.g. through [optuna](https://github.com/optuna/optuna/tree/master/optuna)) to avoid using connection pools when relying on RDBMS. In this case, a connection is made for each transaction then closed afterwards.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nTo control the connections to the database when the program is run by parallel processes (or nodes). Using `pool_size=1` and `max_overflow=1` can efficiently serve this purpose if the script is run by a single process, but doesn't prevent overwhelming the database server when the program is run by parallel processes.\r\n\r\nThe motivation arose when I deployed my program of model training and evaluation for hyperparameters search within an HPC environment. The program instances were aborted due to SQLAlchemy exception indicating that maximum connections to the database has been reached. I also received a report from the server admin conveying that this behavior has affected other users of the database server and limited their access.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [x] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [x] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nBy consulting the documentation of [sqlalchemy.create_engine](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/engines.html#sqlalchemy.create_engine.params.poolclass), this turns out to be solved if we set `poolclass` to `pool.NullPool`.\r\n\r\nHere is a proposed solution for this request:\r\n\r\n[A-Alaa/mlflow/tree/null_pool](https://github.com/A-Alaa/mlflow/tree/null_pool)\r\n",

    "body": "Thank you for submitting a feature request. **Before proceeding, please review MLflow's [Issue Policy for feature requests](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md#feature-requests) and the [MLflow Contributing Guide](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)**.\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this feature request template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n## Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages new feature contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nAPI calls should return `HTTP 400` when the parameters (e.g.) don't match expected data types instead of failing with a `500`. Creating a JSON schema -- using [jsonschema](https://github.com/Julian/jsonschema), for example -- for the MLFlow REST API to check requests against would fix these issues. This would result in far friendlier UX, easier debugging, more predictable responses, and a generally more RESTful API.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nI keep getting `500` errors for things like supplying a parameter to an API call that's the wrong data type. See [this issue](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/5199) for an example. This has also happened with calls to logging parameters (both individually and in batches) and all kinds of other functions.\r\n\r\nRight now, this means that an end user of a running MLFlow service get an error message like this back when something goes wrong:\r\n\r\n```\r\nResponse [https://<<host>>/api/2.0/mlflow/runs/log-batch]\r\n  Date: 2021-12-29 20:15\r\n  Status: 500\r\n  Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\n  Size: 290 B\r\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN\">\r\n<title>500 Internal Server Error</title>\r\n<h1>Internal Server Error</h1>\r\n<p>The server encountered an internal error and was unable to complete your request. Either the server is overloaded or there is an error in the application.</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error was caused by providing a `timestamp` value to `log-batch` that was a character string as opposed to a numeric timestamp.\r\n\r\nObviously, this error is unhelpful. There's no indication of what went wrong or how to fix the issue. More importantly, the `500` is a hint that the client actually _did not do anything wrong_, and that there was a legitimate issue on the server side. For bad parameters (e.g.), this is obviously not the case, and the client should be seeing an error message with information about the incorrect parameter type and what type was expected, not a cryptic `500` with `Unable to complete your request`.\r\n\r\nThe value prop here should be relatively obvious, so I won't write too much beyond just saying that validating requests against a JSON schema would let users of the MLFlow REST API (in other words, every MLFlow user) more easily and reliably use MLFlow, develop wrappers for the MLFlow API, debug their code when things go wrong, etc. etc. etc.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [x] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nI haven't written any JSON schema for Python, but in R I know it's easy to just set up a function to validate requests and then use that function to validate the JSON body of any requests that come in before doing any actual work. If a request fails the JSON validation checks, you can easily return an `HTTP 400 -- JSON validation failed with << some error >>`.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I can help with this improvement! I think it'd be a major step forward for everyone using MLFlow and for the project in general.\r\n",

I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: docker `continuumio/miniconda3` on Azure's Compute Instance\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: R's `install_mlflow()`\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.22.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.9\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nI am trying to use MLFlow on Azure's ML Compute Instances to track my experiments in R. The tracking URI set by the compute instance has the scheme `azureml://...` which is not supported by MLFlow. Azure has a [package](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azureml-mlflow/?view=azure-ml-py) to enable support on Python, but as my code is in R, I found that I need to manually change the URI to `https://...` to make logging work.\r\n\r\nChanging the Tracking URI works correctly (i.e. I can log params and metrics) when setting the `MLFLOW_ARTIFACT_URI` environment variable or when calling `mlflow_set_tracking_uri()`, but it doesn't seem to have any effect on the artifact URI (related to #3469) as it is still using the old scheme (the one starting with `azureml://`), so I am not able to log artifacts.\r\n\r\nI see no method on [MLFlow's R API](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/R-api.html#mlflow-server) to change the artifact's URI scheme (and #2577 seems to be related, but I created a different issue as I don't want to re-define the whole URI, but just the scheme) and workarounds are possible at least while Microsoft implements an R API (I hope it happens someday), but I was wondering if MLFlow has any suggestion on this or if a new feature that could help this use-case is in the plan.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [x] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [x] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n",

Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nIn the experiment comparison, \"compare data on hover\" shows the metric. I feel it might be more useful if the parameters can be shown. \r\n![newplot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46158005/147480978-34621901-7d81-48e9-b909-71ab16c6dd62.png)\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? Comparison of different experimental runs; when the experiments are grouped by parameters. It is currently to convenient (at least for me to track the parameters from graphs).\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? Pls. see above and the graphs.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? Pls see above and graphs.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? Currently, the comparison is not convenient when the experiment management is based on experiments. Eg, if the project name is \"CatsDogsClassification\", the experiment might involve trying out a couple of models. Those would be the experiment name: eg \"DenseNet121\", \"SENet154\".  There would be multiple runs of each of these networks. Now, if we want to compare key parameters, this is not possible unless we start encoding the parameter name in the experiment Run Name. This makes it unnaturally long. Therefore, along with the key metric, if there is some way of displaying the parameters; i think it will be useful.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.

I tried explicitly setting the `archive_existing_versions` argument to a bunch of different things (i.e. `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `\"true\"`, `\"false\"`, etc.) to no avail.\r\n\r\nAnd while we're at I also noticed a small typo in the R package documentation under `?mlflow_transition_model_version_stage`: `Transition 'model_version' to this tage.` --> `Transition 'model_version' to this stage.`. It'd also be helpful to list out what the allowed stages are in the docs and to use something like `match.arg()` [at this point in the code](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/R/mlflow/R/model-registry.R#L302-L306) to match against the allowed stages (I'd be happy to PR this change -- it'd be easy). \r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [x] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [x] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n",

    "body": "Thank you for submitting an issue. Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**:\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**:\r\n- **Python version**:\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\nI was serving a model using MLFlow model serve, the model won't serve until I put the source code in the same directory of the MLModel file so that I serve it. I want to serve the MLModel file without the need of the source code.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\nCan't reproduce.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\nI thought the method load_context() in a wrapper class would help me to avoid this but I couldn't make it didn't have the result I was hoping for either. I implemented it like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Wrapper(PythonModel):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self.logger = get_logger(name='model')\r\n        self.model = None\r\n\r\n    def predict(self, context, model_input):\r\n        self.logger.warning(model_input)\r\n        return self.model.predict(model_input.values)\r\n\r\n    def load_context(self, context):\r\n        self.model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(path_to_model)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [x] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n",

    "body": "### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution:  Linux Ubuntu 18.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from: binary\r\n- **MLflow version: 1.22.0\r\n- **Python version: 3.8\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nThe metrics visualization of all runs in an experiment becomes broken/are just plotted as a single constant value. Instead of showing the actual metric curve just a rectangular big blue box is plotted. Before everything is logged and visualized fine and at some point the metric visualization gets broken. This is then also the case for all metric values and also for previous runs under the same experiment name that were vsualized correctly before. It looks like in the database something is messed up and only the most recent metric value is stored without the past values which results in a overall constant metric. The broken curve looks like this (same for all other metric curves in the same experiment):\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16177860/146753090-9a971e69-5fbe-47cf-b834-eae1be66d685.png)\r\n\r\nI still could not find out when this happens. The only thing I know is that this happens after some time after multiple experiment runs then suddenly all metrics are broken. I should also add that I mostly stopp runs with Ctrl+C and not let them properly finish. \r\n\r\nMinimal code for logging that reproduces this behaviour is: \r\n   ```\r\n mlflow.set_experiment(\"my-example-experiment\")\r\n with mlflow.start_run():\r\n        mlflow.log_param(\"a\", 1)\r\n        mlflow.log_metric(\"b\", 2, step=0)\r\n        mlflow.log_metric(\"b\", 3, step=1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning this many times after some time the metric visualization of \"b\" looks rectangualr/broken instead of a line going from 2 to 3. Did anyone also experience this issue?\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ x] `integrations/azure`: MLFlow tracking server deployed in Azure App Service where the backend store is a managed PostgreSQL database.\r\n",

I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nCreate a new mlflow function in order provide a way to rename the run name. This function could be the `mlflow.set_run_name`\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThis feature will allow the user to rename the run name using the Python API. A use-case that makes this feature valuable is the following: Many tools implements their own mlflow integration without allowing the user to specify the flow run name, in that case it's useful to provide a high-level API for this purpose. This renaming functionality is currently supported by setting the `mlflow.runName` tag but this approach is not friendly for a new user. \r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [x] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [x] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThis new function could look like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef set_run_name(run_id: str, name: str):\r\n    pass  # use the given run_id in order to `mlflow.set_tag('mlflow.runName', name)\r\n```\r\n",

    "body": "### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP2\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: Binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.22 for the **client**, 1.11.0 for the **server**\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6.12\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: `MlflowClient().get_latest_versions(\"SOME_REGISTERED_MODEL\")`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nWe have MlFlow 1.11.0 installed on a server, and version 1.22 on the client. When the client is connected to the server, and executing the `get_latest_version` command, the following message is shown:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nMlflowException: API request to endpoint /api/2.0/mlflow/registered-models/get-latest-versions failed with error code 404 != 200. Response body: '<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN\">\r\n\r\n<title>404 Not Found</title>\r\n\r\n<h1>Not Found</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.</p>\r\n```\r\nThe expected result would have been the latest version information of the model.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n\r\nPrerequisites:\r\n\r\n1. Run mlflow version 1.11.0 on a server in a conda environment\r\n2. Connect a client to the mlflow server using `mlflow.set_tracking_uri()`\r\n3. Create an experiment on the server using `MlflowClient.create_experiment`\r\n\r\nNow run:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\nfrom mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient\r\n\r\nmlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"TRACKING_URI\")\r\n\r\nclient = MlflowClient()\r\nclient.get_latest_versions(\"EXPERIMENT_NAME\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\nThis problem seems to have been introduced with #4999. In that PR, support for POST-calls on get-latest-version was added. \r\nThis by itself is not a problem, since the author of the PR checks that if the POST-call is not available on the server, it catches the `ENDPOINT_NOT_FOUND` exception and tries to use a GET-call. \r\n\r\nThe problem is created however, because it calls `/mlflow/registered-models/get-latest-version` instead of the usual `/preview/mlflow/registered-models/get-latest-versions`. This means  that not an `ENDPONT_NOT_FOUND` exception is thrown, but a 404 Not Found. This exception is not caught, meaning that the program will not continue to try the GET-call and crashes instead.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the omission of `preview` in the URL is the root cause of the bug (see: https://github.com/stevenchen-db/mlflow/blob/9bbbb0c28d285476e0f3e2a81ecfbf577d1b03ca/mlflow/protos/model_registry.proto#L133), but I'm not sure if that is on purpose or not. If the omission of `preview` is on purpose, some other way of exception handling could be implemented to avoid getting 404-errors when working with older servers that do not support POST-calls.\r\n\r\nSince the reason behind the missing `preview` part is not entirely clear to me, I did not want to provide a bug fix immediately. If the maintainers could provide some guidance on which approach to fix this bug would be best for this project, I'd be happy to help implement the change.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [x] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n",

Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nWhen serving a model in a production environment, which is what we would like to use MLflow for, descriptive logs are crucial for being able to do that reliably. \r\nWe serve the model in a docker image built with `mlflow models build-docker` and currently to our best knowledge there are no logs whatsoever (with the exception of the information about starting gunicorn processes). Currently we would appreciate literally any additional pieces of information during runtime - after startup there is no information about whether the service is doing something.\r\nUseful logs could include: Endpoint access, some information about received data (size, structure, ...), output - model prediction, response time, ...\r\nAs building the image is automated and `mlflow models build-docker` currently does not seem to have any possibility to configure logging, achieving this currently seems impossible. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?

    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThis is more of a question than a bug or a feature.\r\n\r\nOn browsing through the model \"flavour\" modules (e.g. pytorch, paddlepaddle etc.), I note that a majority of the code base is contained within the `__init__.py` file of each flavour module and I feel this is slightly unconventional.\r\n\r\n**Is there a reason for this being implemented this way?**\r\n\r\nIf shortening imports is the reason, then bringing all functions to the module level can be achieved by setting `__all__` attribute in the `__init__.py` file. For example, the pytorch model flavour `mlflow.pytorch` could be done this way, with all functions moved to a `pytorch.py` file in the `mflow/pytorch` folder, the `__init__.py` would look as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom .python import log_model, save_model, get_default_conda_env, get_default_pip_requirements\r\n\r\n__all__ = [log_model, save_model, get_default_conda_env, get_default_pip_requirements]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would result in the above functions being accessible through the import:\r\n\r\n`from mlflow.pytorch import log_model`\r\n\r\nJust as though the functions themselves were contained within the `__init__.py` as they currently are.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, breaking the functions out into even more files is possible, as the imports can be collected into the `__init__.py` namespace. If the functions were saved into two separate python file, `model.py` and `env.py`, then they can be called from the pytorch module with the following `__init__.py` structure:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom .model import log_model, save_model\r\nfrom .env import get_default_conda_env, get_default_pip_requirements\r\n\r\n__all__ = [log_model, save_model, get_default_conda_env, get_default_pip_requirements]\r\n```",

    "body": "**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (Occurs both in Windows 11 and Ubuntu 20.04)**:\r\n- **MLflow installed ffrom (pip)**:\r\n- **MLflow version (1.22.0)**:\r\n- **Python version (3.9.6)**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce (MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI = os.environ.get('MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI'))**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nLet's suppose that we work inside a python virtual environment with mlflow installed. A remote MLflow server for tracking is defined inside a .venv file as follows:\r\n```\r\nos.environ[\"MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI\"]= <my_remote_ip>\r\n```\r\nFor some reason, during runtime the command will fail to update the MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI environment variable command contrary to the rest of environment variables. Therefore, the tracking server will be arbitrarily set to the default value, namely localhost:5000.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nWith the above .env file present in the current directory and MLflow and python-dotenv installed in the python virtual environment, run the following code:\r\n```\r\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\r\nload_dotenv()\r\nMLFLOW_TRACKING_URI = os.environ.get('MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI')\r\nprint(MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nNope\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n",

    "body": "### System information\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Docker 20.10.10; `docker-compose` 2.1.1; `Linux 5.13.19-2-MANJARO`\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.21.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.10.0\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce** (in effect):\r\n```bash\r\nmlflow server --host 0.0.0.0 -p 5000 --default-artifact-root /home/mlflow \\\r\n--backend-store-uri postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:${MLFLOW_DB_PASSWORD}@mlflow-db:5432/${MLFLOW_DB_NAME}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI am trying to make mlflow run as a service in docker-compose engine. And I succeeded, provided I only run the sync driver for postgres (`postgresql`). However, using the async driver `asyncpg` makes it so that MLFlow makes SQLAlchemy not be able to create the engine. The relevant files are in [this public gist](https://gist.github.com/bgalvao/49706a5eb30aef2288c6687993ed9879).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Download the [Dockerfile](https://gist.github.com/bgalvao/49706a5eb30aef2288c6687993ed9879#file-dockerfile) and place it in `./mlflow` so that it follows the build context specified at the docker compose file.\r\n2. Download [.env](https://gist.github.com/bgalvao/49706a5eb30aef2288c6687993ed9879#file-env) and [docker-compose.yml](https://gist.github.com/bgalvao/49706a5eb30aef2288c6687993ed9879#file-docker-compose-yml), and place them in `./`.\r\n3. From `./`, run `docker-compose up`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n\r\nTLDR from interpreting the gist is that in effect, the mlflow command that is invoked is\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmlflow server --host 0.0.0.0 -p 5000 --default-artifact-root /home/mlflow \\\r\n--backend-store-uri postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:${MLFLOW_DB_PASSWORD}@mlflow-db:5432/${MLFLOW_DB_NAME}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tried this procedure with and without `+asyncpg` in the SQLAlchemy URI. In the latter case, everything worked:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17158288/145032834-30074deb-ef37-4d77-9127-f2b64ba3795e.png)\r\n\r\nIn the former case (with the `+asyncpg` driver), the GUI does not even start, and this is what the log from `docker-compose up mlflow` has to say:\r\n```\r\n ⠿ Network docker_mlflow         Created                                                             0.0s\r\n ⠿ Container docker-mlflow-db-1  Created                                                             0.0s\r\n ⠿ Container docker-mlflow-1     Created                                                             0.0s\r\nAttaching to docker-mlflow-1\r\ndocker-mlflow-1  | 2021/12/07 12:12:34 WARNING mlflow.store.db.utils: SQLAlchemy engine could not be created.

    "body": "## Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages new feature contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ X] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nI want to be able to define the signature of my model using mlflow and then at inference time do input format validation based on the signature metadata from the artifact. I know loading as `pyfunc` and then calling `predict` does this automatically, as does packaging the project for deployment with mlflow (which I'm not doing because I need more flexibility in the API), but then I lose access to other methods on my underlying model (such as predict_proba for an sklearn model). \r\n\r\nIt looks like I might be able to work around the issue by using `_model_impl` on the pyfunc object to still have access to predict_proba, but that interface may be subject to change:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodel = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(MODEL_URI)\r\nmodel._model_impl.predict_proba(df)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can then do manual validation in a predict_proba endpoint with something like this perhaps (while still having it automatically done when calling predict() otherwise):\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom mlflow.pyfunc import _enforce_schema\r\ninput_schema = model.metadata.get_input_schema()\r\ndf = _enforce_schema(df, input_schema)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there was a built in option to have non-pyfunc models do signature-based validation, or otherwise an officially supported way to load metadata with a loaded model and verify some input based on the signature of that model.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? See above.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? Input validation is important, so giving users ways to utilize it outside of the mlflow-specific deployment cases seems like a good idea.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? It would be great to keep the artifact as the source of truth for the input signature so my model serving can leverage that instead of having it externally defined.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient) I had to dig through the code just to find the workaround above, which may be prone to breaking as mlflow evolves. \r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [X] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n",

Conda env for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nchannels:\r\n- conda-forge\r\ndependencies:\r\n- python=3.8.7\r\n- pip\r\n- pip:\r\n  - mlflow\r\n  - auto-sklearn==0.14.1\r\n  - cloudpickle==2.0.0\r\n  - scikit-learn==0.24.2\r\nname: mlflow-env\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I later try to call `load_model` I expected it would \"just work\", but I instead get an error since autosklearn doesn't exist in the python environment:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/sklearn/__init__.py\", line 549, in load_model\r\n    return _load_model_from_local_file(\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/sklearn/__init__.py\", line 417, in _load_model_from_local_file\r\n    return cloudpickle.load(f)\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'autosklearn'\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it appears my assumption that the requirements would automatically be bundled with the model are wrong. But I also don't see any options on `log_model` or `load_model` that would either package the requirements with the model artifact or attempt an install before the load. Perhaps my issue here is that my workflow is off target, but after a lot of searching the docs / github / stackoverflow I'm not finding a clear answer on the proper workflow to handle a case like this. \r\n\r\nIs there an existing example that shows programmatically using the conda env or requirements.txt info from the artifact to create an environment prior to a `load_model` call? Or am I just expected to be handling inference environment creation separately? Of course the latter is doable, but I was hoping there would be some way to have the artifact be the source of truth for the environment...otherwise one needs to coordinate the training environment with the inference environment by other means. Again, doable, but I think I misunderstood that this was supposed to be a thing MLFlow somehow took care of for you.\r\n\r\nNote, I'm going to be using BentoML for model containerization and deployment. Roughly following [this](https://github.com/bentoml/gallery/blob/pre-v1.0/bentomlflow/mlflow-to-bentoml-example.ipynb) example. Not expecting anyone here to comment on the Bento side of things, just adding this as a data point as I was hoping to keep the model serving code independent of the training code as much as possible. The training environments are all containerized but have more requirements than I'd really need for inference, so just using that same image isn't ideal. \r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: I've come across `mlflow models prepare-env` which I may be able to utilize in a build step to create the env from the artifact definition. Will give that a shot.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [X] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nMany tutorials suggests a set of best practices to follow when designing REST APIs:\r\n- https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/03/02/best-practices-for-rest-api-design/\r\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design\r\n- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rest-api-best-practices-rest-endpoint-design-examples/\r\n- https://restfulapi.net/rest-api-design-tutorial-with-example/#model-uris\r\n\r\nThey have common practices:\r\n- Use plural nouns and avoid verbs in endpoints\r\n- Conform to HTTP semantics\r\n- Use Nesting on Endpoints to Show Relationships\r\n- Allow filtering, sorting, and pagination\r\n\r\nMLFlow REST API violates most theses practices:\r\n- it uses nouns in endpoint like `2.0/mlflow/runs/get`\r\n- it  uses the HTTP request data to send resource id like `experiment_id` for [`UpdateExeperiment`](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/rest-api.html#update-experiment)\r\n- it uses `POST` to delete resources\r\n\r\nThis issue is about making the MLFlow REST API more standard by following the best practices.\r\n\r\nIf we do that, we'll have endpoints like:\r\n- `/api/experiments`, `GET` to list the experiments `POST` to create a new experiment\r\n- `/api/experiments/:id`, `GET` to get the experiment metadata, `PUT`/`PATCH` to update it, `DELETE` to delete it\r\n- `/api/experiments/:id/runs`,  `GET` to list the runs of the experiment, `POST` to create a new run \r\n- `/api/runs/:id`, `GET` to get the run metadata, `PUT`/`PATCH` to update it, `DELETE` to delete it\r\n- `/api/runs/:id/parameters`,  `GET` to get the parameters logged during that run, `POST` to log a new parameter\r\n- `/api/runs/:id/parameters/:name`, `GET` to get the value of the parameter, `DELETE` to delete it\r\n- `/api/runs/:id/metrics`, `GET` to get the metrics logged during that run, `POST` to log a new metric\r\n- `/api/runs/:id/metric/:name`, `GET` to get the value of the metric, `DELETE` to delete it\r\n- `/api/runs/:id/tags`, `GET` to get the tags logged during that run, `POST` to log new tag\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- This will make working with the REST API intuitive and easy to understand\r\n- It'll make it possible to use Nginx's `request_auth` feature to implement authorization over MLFlow requests, it's not possible right now becuase Nginx `auth_request` erases the data before sending `/authorize` requests and MLFlow sends the `experiment_id/run_id` in the data of `POST` and `UPDATE` requests instead of the URL (POST /tracking/experiments/1), this makes it impossible to authorize such requests, see this comment: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/761#issuecomment-981738147\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [x] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.

    "body": "Thank you for submitting a feature request. **Before proceeding, please review MLflow's [Issue Policy for feature requests](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md#feature-requests) and the [MLflow Contributing Guide](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)**.\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this feature request template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n## Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages new feature contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nAt my company we make use of object versioning in S3 buckets to avoid accidental overwrites of model objects. By using a specific object version we can be sure that we're using the correct model in our serving container but in the same time give the flexibility to data scientists to have read/write (but not delete) access to the S3 bucket where we store model objects. I propose a new feature to support downloading object versions from S3 buckets in `S3ArtifactRepository`.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nMany companies make use of S3 bucket versioning to avoid accidental overwrites of objects. `S3ArtifactRepository` could conform to this best practice by accepting an optional version id when downloading objects from S3 buckets.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef _download_file(self, remote_file_path, local_path, version_id=None):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Download a version of an object from S3. If version_id is not specified,\r\n        it downloads the latest version.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        (bucket, s3_root_path) = data.parse_s3_uri(self.artifact_uri)\r\n        s3_full_path = posixpath.join(s3_root_path, remote_file_path)\r\n        s3_client = self._get_s3_client()\r\n\r\n        extra_args = {}\r\n        if version_id:\r\n            extra_args = {'VersionId': version_id}\r\n\r\n        s3_client.download_file(bucket, s3_full_path, local_path, ExtraArgs=extra_args)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\nThis feature could help teams operating MLflow repositories on S3 buckets by allowing them to make use of bucket versioning.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\nAt my company we rely on bucket versioning to guarantee availability of models and in the same time give the flexibility to users to read/write in buckets where the models are stored. By using this feature we wouldn't have to worry about accidental overwriting of objects.\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\nAs of now MLflow doesn't support downloading object versions from S3 buckets in `S3ArtifactRepository`. We currently achieve this by using an MLflow plugin that subclasses `S3ArtifactRepository` and adds the functionality for object versions. If object versions are not supported by `S3ArtifactRepository` then a bucket (or bucket prefix) where model objects are stored has to be read only for data scientist users to avoid accidental overwrites. We believe that read only permission is not flexible enough and support for object versions can improve the user experience.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature. If you have a proposal for how to implement this feature, please include it here. For implementation guidelines, please refer to the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#contribution-guidelines).)\r\n\r\nI propose updating the following functions/classes:\r\n* `mlflow.<model>.load_model`: Accept version id when using S3 to download model artefacts\r\n* `mlflow.tracking.artifact_utils._download_artifact_from_uri`: Accept version id when using S3 to download model artefacts\r\n* `mlflow.store.artifact.artifact_repo.ArtifactRepository.download_artifacts`: Accept version id when using S3 to download model artefacts\r\n* `mlflow.store.artifact.s3_artifact_repo.S3ArtifactRepository._download_file`:  Use optional version id to download file from S3\r\n\r\n### Considerations\r\n\r\nVersioning S3 \"folders\"/prefixes can be hideous since version id is assigned to objects, not prefixes. We solve this by compressing MLflow model folders to ZIP files and storing those on S3 buckets. This makes object versioning much easier. We could add this functionality too to `S3ArtifactRepository`.\r\n",

Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Centos7\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: conda install -c conda-forge \r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: version 1.21.0\r\n- **Python version**:  Python 3.7.11\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: No\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nI was trying to use a remote HDFS to store my models, as a backend-artifact-root. Unfortunately, I got this error that said cannot find Hadoop. I did not install Hadoop on my local machine since the data engineer insist that there is no way that I can only figure it out by installing a Hadoop locally and a Hadoop installed on the server should be enough. I spent a few days still cannot save my models to HDFS, so I hope anyone here could help me. Thanks a lot!\r\n \r\nHere's my process:\r\n1. First I start a mlflow server on the remote AWS EC2 like that\r\n```\r\nmlflow server \\\r\n         --backend-store-uri mysql+pymysql://root:pwd@localhost/mlflow_tracking_database \\\r\n         --default-artifact-root hdfs://localhost:14000/webhdfs/v1/models_artifacts?op=LISTSTATUS \\\r\n         --host 0.0.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.

    "body": "Thank you for submitting a feature request. **Before proceeding, please review MLflow's [Issue Policy for feature requests](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md#feature-requests) and the [MLflow Contributing Guide](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)**.\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this feature request template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n## Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages new feature contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [X] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nThe Deployment Plugin `predict()` interface (https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.deployments.html#mlflow.deployments.BaseDeploymentClient.predict) currently only accepts tabular data in the form of Pandas DataFrames. However, the pyfunc MLflow Model format now supports evaluation of tensors, in addition to tabular data. This `predict()` interface should be updated to support all of the data types that are supported by `mlflow.pyfunc.PyFuncModel.predict()` (https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#mlflow.pyfunc.PyFuncModel). The CLI should also be updated to accept serialized versions of these additional tensor input types.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, the `mlflow.models.predict()` interface has the same limitation.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? Support inference of deployed tensor-based models through a unified API.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? Many MLflow users deploy tensor-based models.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? ^\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? See above.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [X] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations",

    "body": "Thank you for submitting a feature request. **Before proceeding, please review MLflow's [Issue Policy for feature requests](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md#feature-requests) and the [MLflow Contributing Guide](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)**.\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this feature request template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n## Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages new feature contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n(In a few sentences, provide a clear, high-level description of the feature request)\r\nEnable `mlflow.log_params` to log parameters with length over 250 characters.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nWe use `mlflow.log_params` to log parameters in the training pipeline.\r\nThe parameters could be hyperparameters or which text columns to used for the model. Some of the parameters have long names which may come from another platform like ETL which causes the following error:\r\n```\r\nmlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: Param value '[...' had length 376, which exceeded length limit of 250\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n    1. It would be easier for pytorch lightning users to log parameters with length over 250 characters. Please find the below issue and the PR accordingly.\r\n    https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/5892\r\n    https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/pull/5893\r\n    2. We also found the same feature requests in the past:\r\n    https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1976\r\n    https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3931\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nIf it is possible for `mlflow.log_params` to expand the length limit, it would be easier for us to manage logs across platforms.\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nTo achieve this use case, we need to build another logger to maintain the logs.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature. If you have a proposal for how to implement this feature, please include it here. For implementation guidelines, please refer to the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#contribution-guidelines).)\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/7b4ab0e4cac5d4c2d2cbfcd3d12aa55b2ee83efe/mlflow/utils/validation.py#L29",

Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\n(In a few sentences, provide a clear, high-level description of the feature request)\r\n\r\nThe _validate_param_name and _validate_tag_name methods are being called twice during the log_batch call, once in the _tracking_service\\client.py and again inside the _validate_batch_log_data function call in both sqlalchemy_store and the file_store. The _validate_batch_log_data in turn calls the _validate_param and _validate_tag methods. \r\n\r\nThere are two ways of fixing the redundant call for _validate_param_name and _validate_tag_name\r\n1. Remove from log_batch in _tracking_service\\client.py\r\n2. Remove from the _validate_param and _validate_tag methods\r\n\r\nI think option 2 works because if we use option 1 there wont be a call to _validate_param_name and _validate_tag_name in case of rest_store.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [x] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.

    "body": "Thank you for submitting an issue. Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu18.04, Windows 10\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: MLflow R SDK from https://cloud.r-project.org/\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.20.2\r\n- **Python version**: NA\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nIn R MLflow SDK as a part of mlflow_log_model api call [timestamp](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/d6ae84164987e2881cdffdce07f7dcf0e3d94aaa/mlflow/R/mlflow/R/model.R#L57) generated to capture model creation time, is an invalid timestamp string.\r\n \r\nA sample timestamp string generated is **21-11-11T21:49:25.25.46**. This string cannot be parsed by C# [DateTime.Parse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime.parse?view=net-5.0#System_DateTime_Parse_System_String_) and throws following error **[System.FormatException: String was not recognized as a valid DateTime**\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\n1. Run following R code in R Studio to generate a timestamp as generated to [mlflow_log_model ](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/d6ae84164987e2881cdffdce07f7dcf0e3d94aaa/mlflow/R/mlflow/R/model.R#L30)API\r\n```R\r\nmlflow_timestamp <- function() {\r\n  withr::with_options(\r\n    c(digits.secs = 2),\r\n    format(\r\n      as.POSIXlt(Sys.time(), tz = \"GMT\"),\r\n      \"%y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%OS\"\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nmlflow_timestamp ()\r\n```\r\n2. Copy the timestamp string generated in step 1 and run following C# code\r\n```csharp\r\nusing System;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\npublic class Program\r\n{\r\n\tpublic static void Main()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t//Corrected Date Format in string\r\n\t\t \t\tstring test = \"21-11-11T21:49:25.25.46\";\r\n\t\t\t\t//Convert the string date value to datetime \r\n                DateTime DT = DateTime.Parse(test);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t \tConsole.WriteLine(\"Value in datetime format : \" + DT);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will result in following error: \r\n```csharp\r\nStack Trace:\r\n\r\n[System.FormatException: String was not recognized as a valid DateTime.]\r\n   at System.DateTimeParse.Parse(String s, DateTimeFormatInfo dtfi, DateTimeStyles styles)\r\n   at System.DateTime.Parse(String s)\r\n   at Program.Main() :line 10\r\n```\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [X] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n",

I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nI want to add a separate TensorFlow Lite flavor (tflite) to the list of supported MLFlow flavors. \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- ***What is the use case for this feature?*** - To use mlflow functionality for the TensorFlow Lite models for logging runs and storing artefacts in a format, suitable to be propagated to the embedded devices without any extra change required. \r\n- ***Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?*** - it gives MLflow users ability to build end-to-end integration between environments when models are defined and trained and target embedded environments that support TensorFlow Lite runtime for inference. \r\n- ***Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?*** - I serve as a consultant for US based client with 1M+ consumer IoT devices running ML models. We are currently using Databricks for the model development and training. When there is time for the model to be propagated to the embedded device, we use custom enhancement  over mlfow.models.Model to specify log, save, load and pyfunc load logic for integration of TensorFlow Lite with MLFlow. It works as expected, but having this workaround is increasing complexity (we either need to reference custom class in each notebook by running notebook with class declaration code, or create a separate module with this class and install on cluster).  \r\n- ***Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case?***  - as specified above, it is achievable through custom class declaration using inheritance from mlflow, however, it doesn't provide proper integration and should be considered as a bed pattern. \r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [X] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nIf approved I can link my pull request as a proposal for implementation. \r\nI used existing implementations of the flavors as reference during development. \r\n",

    "body": "## What changes are proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs per spaCy v3, the recommended way to train your spaCy pipelines is via the [`spacy train` command](https://spacy.io/usage/training). This pull request adds a callback logger, which can be an entry point that can later be registered to the spaCy `config.cfg`. This can efficiently report spaCy training metrics, params and models into MLFlow without having separate training scripts in many use cases in my organisation. There is already an [issue](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4953) which reflects this, though it's regarding the documentation.\r\n\r\nAs per a discussion on a [pull request](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/pull/7961) for registering an MLFlow logger into spaCy logger registry concluded on adding a logger here, that will be maintained by MLFlow community, which can be added as an [entry point](https://spacy.io/usage/saving-loading#entry-points) in `spacy_loggers` [registry](https://spacy.io/api/top-level#registry).\r\n\r\n## How is this patch tested?\r\nPerformed integration tests with spaCy CLI trainers\r\n\r\n## Release Notes\r\nAdding in callback logger for logging spaCy training metrics, parameters and models into MLflow that can be used in spaCy \r\nby specifying MLflow as the logger in spaCy training config.\r\nE.g.:\r\n```properties\r\n[training.logger]\r\n@loggers = \"spacy.MLFlow.v1\"\r\nrun_name = \"monitor_spacy_training\"\r\nremove_config_values = [\"paths.train\", \"paths.dev\", \"corpora.train.path\", \"corpora.dev.path\"]\r\nlog_interval = 100\r\nlog_dataset_dir = \"corpus\"\r\nlog_best_model = true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a user-facing change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] No. You can skip the rest of this section.\r\n- [x] Yes. Give a description of this change to be included in the release notes for MLflow users.\r\n\r\nAdding in callback logger for logging spaCy training metrics, parameters and models into MLflow that can be used in spaCy \r\nby specifying MLflow as the logger in spaCy training config.\r\nE.g.:\r\n```properties\r\n[training.logger]\r\n@loggers = \"spacy.MLFlow.v1\"\r\nrun_name = \"monitor_spacy_training\"\r\nremove_config_values = [\"paths.train\", \"paths.dev\", \"corpora.train.path\", \"corpora.dev.path\"]\r\nlog_interval = 100\r\nlog_dataset_dir = \"corpus\"\r\nlog_best_model = true\r\n```\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this PR affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInsert an empty named anchor here to allow jumping to this section with a fragment URL\r\n(e.g. https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/123#user-content-release-note-category).\r\nNote that GitHub prefixes anchor names in markdown with \"user-content-\".\r\n-->\r\n<a name=\"release-note-category\"></a>\r\n### How should the PR be classified in the release notes?

Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this documentation issue to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes. I can contribute a documentation fix independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a document fix with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a documentation fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### URL(s) with the issue:\r\n\r\nPlease provide a link to the documentation entry in question: https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.log_param\r\n\r\n### Description of proposal (what needs changing):\r\n\r\nHi folks, ran into the 250 character limit of `log_param` when I passed the command used to call my script in `sys.argv` to MLflow. For context, MLflow gave me this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: Param value '<my-super-long-string>' had length 260, which exceeded length limit of 250\r\n```\r\n\r\nHaven't had the time to trace the source of the character limit, but have a hunch that it depends on the tracking server being used. I ran into this error when using a `sqlite` backend.\r\n\r\nThought it would be worth mentioning in the docs, since exceeding the char limit throws an exception and can interrupt training jobs w/o the user being aware up front. Would like to suggest adding a warning similar to how [log_image](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.log_image) warns users for values out of range.\r\n",

    "body": "Thank you for submitting an issue. Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: No\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows Server 2019\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.20.3\r\n- **Python version**: 3.6.13\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: mlflow_transition_model_version_stage(name, version, stage = \"Production\", archive_existing_versions = TRUE)\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nmlflow_rest function fails in requests with boolean variables. This is caused by the use of rapply(data, as.character, how = \"replace\"), which quotes the boolean variables, replacing them as characters. \r\n\r\nThis can easily be fixed by adding the argument 'classes = c(\"numeric\", \"character\")' to the rapply statement. This excludes boolean variables from being converted.\r\n\r\nAn example is when using the mlflow_transition_model_version_stage() function with the archive_existing_versions argument. \r\nThis function throws the error:\r\n \"Error: API request to endpoint 'model-versions/transition-stage' failed with error code 500. Reponse body: '<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN\">\r\n<title>500 Internal Server Error</title>\r\n<h1>Internal Server Error</h1>\r\n<p>The server encountered an internal error and was unable to complete your request. Either the server is overloaded or there is an error in the application.</p>\r\n' \"\r\n\r\nFor now it can be circumvented in R by calling the REST API directly without the 'rapply' wrapper.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\nmlflow_transition_model_version_stage(name, version, stage = \"Production\", archive_existing_versions = TRUE)\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.

    "body": "Thank you for submitting an issue. Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 (Ootpa)\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: Binary (I think? 🙂 Installed through `pip` via `poetry`)\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.21.0\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.8.6\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: NA\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: See code for reproducing\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior is for `client.get_metric_history` to return an empty list when the given metric has not been logged before. Actual behavior is a raised exception with the message:\r\n```\r\nmlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: Metric 'accuracy' not found under run '4e18eced00654b2db9165ceda272c592'\r\n```\r\n\r\nCalling `get_metric_history` for a `MlflowClient` raises an exception when the given metric has not been logged before. In the documentation it says that the return value is: \"A list of :py:class:`mlflow.entities.Metric` entities if logged, else empty list\".\r\n\r\nEither the documentation is incorrect or the code (atleast for file store) is. See `mlflow.store.tracking.file_store.FileStore::_get_metric_history` for root cause of exception.\r\n\r\nI have only tested this using the file store.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nwith mlflow.start_run() as run:\r\n    run_id = run.info.run_id\r\n\r\n    # Call client.get_metric_history\r\n    client = mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient()\r\n    metric_history = client.get_metric_history(run_id, \"accuracy\")\r\n\r\n    # Should be an empty list, as per the documentation\r\n    # Instead it raises an `mlflow.exceptions.MlflowException`\r\n    assert metric_history == []\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"~/contrib/mlflow/getmetrichistory.py\", line 9, in <module>\r\n    metric_history = client.get_metric_history(active_run_id, \"accuracy\")\r\n  File \"~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/getmetrichistory-gdY77lq0-py3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/client.py\", line 217, in get_metric_history\r\n    return self._tracking_client.get_metric_history(run_id, key)\r\n  File \"~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/getmetrichistory-gdY77lq0-py3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/_tracking_service/client.py\", line 76, in get_metric_history\r\n    return self.store.get_metric_history(run_id=run_id, metric_key=key)\r\n  File \"~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/getmetrichistory-gdY77lq0-py3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/store/tracking/file_store.py\", line 644, in get_metric_history\r\n    return self._get_metric_history(run_info, metric_key)\r\n  File \"~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/getmetrichistory-gdY77lq0-py3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mlflow/store/tracking/file_store.py\", line 650, in _get_metric_history\r\n    raise MlflowException(\r\nmlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: Metric 'accuracy' not found under run '4e18eced00654b2db9165ceda272c592'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n",

    "body": "## Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages new feature contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nIt would be really helpful to have `dotenv` file support to specify environment variables (e.g. tracking uri) in a project-specific way so that it can be shared across teams. MLFlow could read the local dotenv file and set its tracking/artifact uri (both the command line and the library)\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nThe tracking URI can be committed into version control and be will be ready-to-go when the repo is cloned. It also makes mlflow easier to use by implicitly transferring the responsibility of setting the tracking/artifact uri to the library itself. \r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nSetting tracking/artifact uri is an infrastructural concern which can be off-loaded to a dedicated file that is read implicitly. It will make running mlflow for new users even simpler since they can focus on the ml code and not the infrastructure. Additionally, setting environment variables is not simple for new users, especially across platforms (windows for example requires a multi-step process unless using powershell and `$Env:...`). \r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nMakes it simpler to get started with mlflow, can share code templates across projects without worrying about setting the tracking/artifact uri.\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nThis is more of a convenience feature, the current mlflow features and components are sufficient however this feature would further help move the focus from experiment management to the experiment itself. Especially for newer users in a project who just want to get something running.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [x] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [x] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [x] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThis feature should be quite simple to implement given the abundance of `dotenv` loader libraries across most language ecosystems. The file should be loaded when mlflow initialises and reads environment variables.",

Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nWe are trying to use MLFlow model REST serving to run image inference. Images are typically sent with content types like `application/octet-stream`, `multipart/form-data`, `image/jpeg`, etc. Going through the MLFlow docs it does not look like those content types are supported and instead images need to be base64-encoded as part of a JSON payload:\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/examples/flower_classifier#how-to-train-and-deploy-image-classifier-with-mlflow-and-keras\r\nAdding support for binary HTTP payload would be more client friendly and increase performance.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? Realtime image inference\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? It would bring MLFlow serving on par with production-level services like Azure Cognitive Services [[API doc](https://southcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/Custom_Vision_Prediction_3.1/operations/5eb37d24548b571998fde5f3)]\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? It would provide a uniform way to manage models and endpoints, whether they deal with JSON, images, audio, etc.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient) Base64-encoding-in-JSON of images is an unusual way for REST APIs to handle images.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [x] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature. If you have a proposal for how to implement this feature, please include it here. For implementation guidelines, please refer to the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#contribution-guidelines).)\r\n\r\nOne option could be for the server to expand its supported content types and use Pillow to convert images to Pandas. Ideally this would integrate with transform pipelines in PyTorch, Tensforflow, etc. to avoid drift between training and inference (ex: scaling color channels by 1/255, etc.).\r\n",

An error is shown, reading:\r\n\r\n> Something went wrong\r\n> If this error persists, please report an issue [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5700041/138704907-a775ffb1-5ae0-47ea-a597-4cac648c7d6a.png)\r\n\r\nI don't have any business case for supporting apostrophes, but it would be nice if the UI prevented me creating a model that can't be opened later.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [x] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n",

I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n-  No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: Yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Ubuntu 20.04\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: pip\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.20.2\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.9.1\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: NA\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: NA\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nI'm using a spark training method to train the model and store the model as pyspark flavour inside a container environment. However, for prediction, I'm using another container with python base image and trying to do prediction using pyfunc flavour. However, this tells me to install pyspark in the prediction cluster. Is there any way I could make the pyspark model interoperable  across various flavour without actually using pyspark in my prediction/model-serving container?\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nTraining code:\r\n----------------------\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression\r\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler, StandardScaler\r\nfrom pyspark.ml import Pipeline\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\r\nfrom pyspark.ml.evaluation import MulticlassClassificationEvaluator\r\n\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nmlflow.set_registry_uri(\"mysql+pymysql://root:root@127.0.0.1:3306/mlflow_tracking_database\")\r\nmlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"http://127.0.0.1:5000\")\r\nmr_uri = mlflow.get_registry_uri()\r\nprint(\"Current registry uri: {}\".format(mr_uri))\r\ntracking_uri = mlflow.get_tracking_uri()\r\nprint(\"Current tracking uri: {}\".format(tracking_uri))\r\n\r\n\r\nexpr_name = \"Sample_spark_aws_exp\"  #

    "body": "## Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages new feature contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n \r\n- [x] Yes. We can contribute this feature independently within the @AmadeusITGroup/mlflow-contributors team.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n \r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n \r\nAs of today, MLflow enables serving an ML model as a REST API endpoint for inference.\r\nThere are cases where a REST API is not suitable, and a gRPC API would be preferable instead.\r\nAs a building block for providing a gRPC inference server, the gRPC grammar corresponding to a given MLflow model is needed.\r\nThe grammar would easily allow the generation of both client and server code.\r\n \r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nServing and consuming an MLflow model through a gRPC channel.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nBecause of the advantages of the gRPC protocol related to performance (e.g., smaller binary payload) and to the native code generation.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nTo leverage gRPC performance in the context of serving a model within an Amadeus Fast Data microservice architecture.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nCurrently, to have a gRPC inference server/client, the grammar has to be generated manually or with custom tooling.\r\n \r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents\r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n \r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n \r\nLanguages\r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n \r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n \r\n## Details\r\n \r\nThe gRPC grammar seems to be tightly related to the model signature. Therefore a first proposal would be to add a new `grpc` module, within the `models` package, handling the generation of the grammar. It would be then possible to leverage the existing `mlflow.log_text()` API to materialize the gRPC grammar as an experiment run artifact.\r\n \r\nExample of usage:\r\n \r\n```\r\nimport mlflow.models.signature as signature\r\nimport mlflow.models.grpc as grpc\r\n \r\n...\r\n\r\nmodel_signature = signature.infer_signature(...)\r\ngrpc_grammar = grpc.generate_grammar(model_signature)\r\nmlflow.log_text(grpc_grammar, \"grpc_grammar.proto\")\r\n \r\n...\r\n```",

For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Linux RHEL 7\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.7.2, also in current version\r\n- **Python version**: 3.7\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: -\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nThe following code blocks:\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/a46bb1f3f69940768e1f6b5e583f99703bd4dfeb/mlflow/store/artifact/hdfs_artifact_repo.py#L22-L24\r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/a46bb1f3f69940768e1f6b5e583f99703bd4dfeb/mlflow/store/artifact/hdfs_artifact_repo.py#L157-L184\r\nwill encounter: `ArrowIOError: HDFS list directory failed, errno: 255 (Unknown error 255) Please check that you are connecting to the correct HDFS RPC port`\r\nwith java backend error: `UnknownHostException: java.net.UnknownHostException: Invalid host name: local host is: (unknown); destination host is: \"myhdfs-ns\":8020; java.net.UnknownHostException; For more details see:  http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/UnknownHost`\r\nwhen we use `--default-artifact-root hdfs://MyHDFS-ns/mlflow_artifacts`.\r\nIn our hadoop dfs.nameservices set to MyHDFS-ns in $HADOOP_CONF_DIR/hdfs-site.xml. Urllib converts name service (from --default-artifact-root) to lowercase (myhdfs-ns). After it pyarrow can't connect to hdfs correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\nYou need hadoop with dfs.nameservices with Uppercase as in our case.\r\nStart mlflow server with  key `--default-artifact-root hdfs://{dfs.nameservices}/mlflow_artifacts` and try to read, write or list artifacts.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nWe found 2 WA for this bug.\r\n1) With our hadoop and pyarrow==0.15.1 we comment host, port, user and driver variables: \r\nhttps://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/a46bb1f3f69940768e1f6b5e583f99703bd4dfeb/mlflow/store/artifact/hdfs_artifact_repo.py#L172-L175\r\n\r\n2) We corrupt our $HADOOP_CONF_DIR/hdfs-site.xml with lowercase dfs.nameservices.\r\n\r\nBoth wa is wrong way to fix this bug.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n",

    "body": "Thank you for submitting an issue. Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: windows 10\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.20.2\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \r\n  - Start server: `mlflow models serve -m runs:/5f8aee52fcb442388368af4da658b398/model --no-conda`\r\n  -  Submit an inference request: `curl -i -X POST -d \"{\\\"data\\\":0.0199132142]}\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://localhost:5000/invocations`\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nSubmitting an inference requests to the MLFlow model server with invalid content returns HTTP error 500 'Internal Server Error' instead of HTTP error 400 'Bad Request'. This prevents proper error handling on the client side and blocks REST API fuzzing.\r\n\r\nEx:\r\n```\r\ncurl -i -X POST -d \"{\\\"data\\\":0.0199132142]}\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://localhost:5000/invocations\r\nHTTP/1.1 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR\r\nContent-Length: 901\r\nContent-Type: application/json\r\nDate: Wed, 13 Oct 2021 22:16:44 GMT\r\nServer: mlflow\r\n\r\n{\"error_code\": \"MALFORMED_REQUEST\", \"message\": \"Failed to parse input from JSON.

    "body": "the current default is records, which is highly inefficient for reasonable sized datasets.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Gerben Oostra <gerben.oostra@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n## What changes are proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nGives callers to the pyfunc rest api (/invocations) the possibility to pass a header 'Orientation', that can be valued 'columns', 'records' or 'split'. This will change the json serialization of the returned pandas dataframe.\r\n\r\nCurrently only 'records' is used, which adds a lot of content to the json.

    "body": "Thank you for submitting an issue. Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.20.2\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.7.10\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nThe problem I encountered is that `Run Command` showed on frontend when I run experiment on databricks shows different command than command that was actually used for running the experiment and therefore the experiment is not reproducible.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\nFor example if I run locally:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow run . -e main -P parameter=ab -b databricks --backend-config meta/training_cluster.json --experiment-name /some/path/experiment-1 --no-conda\r\n```\r\n\r\nI end up on databricks mlflow frontend with following command being shown as `Run Command`:\r\n```\r\nmlflow run file:///Users/xxx/projects/project -v xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx -e main -b databricks -P parameter=ab\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere some of the parameters I used are missing (`backend-config`, `no-conda`, `experiment-name`) and therefore the run is not reproducible.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar issue happens if I use mlflow run from python:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        mlflow.projects.run(\r\n            uri='.', \r\n            entry_point='main',\r\n            backend='databricks',\r\n            backend_config='meta/training_cluster.json',\r\n            synchronous=True,\r\n            experiment_name='/some/path/experiment-1',\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that case the `Run Command` shown of frontend is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow run file:///Users/xxx/projects/project -v xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx -e main -b local\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere the `Run Command` says it was run locally and not on databricks and therefore it is misleading and not reproducible.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [x] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [x] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n",

    "body": "### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows 10\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**:1.20.2\r\n- **Python version**:3.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:mlflow models serve -m runs:/5f8aee52fcb442388368af4da658b398/model\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nWe run `pip install` in [hash-checking mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#hash-checking-mode) to prevent package tampering. MLFlow does not support this by default so I provided the `requirements.txt` file explicitly:\r\n```\r\n    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(\r\n        model,\r\n        artifact_path = \"model\",\r\n        signature = mlflow.models.infer_signature(X_train[:10], y_train[:10]),\r\n        input_example = X_train[:10],\r\n        pip_requirements = \"requirements.txt\")\r\n```\r\nInstead of using the `requirements.txt` file as-is, MLFlow added an extra `mlflow` entry in the list of PIP requirements. This `mlflow` entry has no version or hash, which breaks `pip install` when trying to serve the model.

Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nThe server's home page shows the default experiment which means hitting `/` sends `GET /experiments/get?experiment_id=0` to the server, in a multi-user access controlled environment where a user only have access to his experiments (the ownership information and access control mechanics are delegated to a separated application) this means all users accessing MLFlow will try to get the default experiment which they don't have access to.\r\n\r\nWhy does MLFlow do that? Why don't the home page just shows the experiments list or general information not related to any experiment?\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nWe're having this problem as part of our MLOps platform https://iko.ai particularly when implementing access control mechanics for MLFlow resources\r\n\r\nAccess control is important for privacy, users should not be allowed to see others' experiments and tracking data\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations",

Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nSupport running of a MLproject on an existing Databricks cluster. Right now, the mlflow api only accepts a new cluster configuration when running a project on Databricks. We would like it to accept the `existing_cluster_id` as described in the [Databricks API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/api/latest/jobs#--request-structure-6) as well.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nUsers can more quickly run a mlflow project on an existing cluster that is already started up instead of waiting for the new cluster to be created (around 5 min), and the conda environment to be created (again a couple of minutes). \r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nMore flexibility in choosing how to run a project on Databricks via the API or CLI.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nUsers of our ML platform (using mlflow & databricks) have been asking for the ability to use an existing cluster to test out their runs with a quicker feedback loop.\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nIt's not especially difficult, just more time-consuming to have to wait for the cluster and conda environment to be created before being able to see if the run will start or be successful. \r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [x] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [x] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature. If you have a proposal for how to implement this feature, please include it here.

    "body": "## Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages new feature contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nWe are running the MLflow server on K8s using S3 and RDS. Successfully logging an artifact which is a 2MB JSON file, however when trying to view this file within the UI it takes a long time to load (minutes) and Firefox even complains it is slowing the browser down. \r\n\r\nThen if a user clicks off and tries to view once again the loading restarts. This is not a great UX, so the enhancements I would suggest:\r\n\r\n* Try to load these larger files a different / faster way\r\n* If that's not entirely possible change the UI to tell the user to wait a little longer or a loading bar on first load and then ... \r\n* Implement some form of caching to enable faster second load\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? Large file viewing in the artifact screens\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? Some artifacts are not necessarily small and would be useful for debugging experiments and their runs\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? We use various pieces of metadata and extra artifacts in our ensemble or pipelines which are useful to been seen alongside our metrics\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient) as explained above it's mostly around latency and UX not quite being there for this use case\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nI am no frontend developer but imagine it's a UI update for the loading bar and then leveraging in browser caches potentially. \r\n",

    "body": "Thank you for submitting an issue. Please refer to our [issue policy](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md) for additional information about bug reports. For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: yes\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: Windows 10, WSL2\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: PyPI\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: 1.20.2\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8.10\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: n/a\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: mlflow run .\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\nUsing a Win10/WSL2/docker setup, the container mount path to the artifact store is incorrect. From the logs:\r\n\r\n2021/09/29 10:41:52 INFO mlflow.projects.backend.local: === Running command 'docker run --rm -v C:\\Users\\jacobss\\gitlab\\test-mlflow-project\\mlruns:/mlflow/tmp/mlruns -v C:\\Users\\jacobss\\gitlab\\test-mlflow-project\\mlruns\\0\\2084a026daf8461fad6474e83532b9ce\\artifacts:C:\\Users\\jacobss\\gitlab\\test-mlflow-project\\mlruns\\0\\2084a026daf8461fad6474e83532b9ce\\artifacts -e MLFLOW_RUN_ID=2084a026daf8461fad6474e83532b9ce -e MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=file:///mlflow/tmp/mlruns -e MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_ID=0 mlflow-experiments:6432e77 bash ./main.sh' in run with ID '2084a026daf8461fad6474e83532b9ce' ===\r\n\r\nSo the first volume mount (of mlruns) is fine, but the second one has windows paths for both the source path (correct) and the destination path (incorrect).\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.

Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute to this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nWhile using `load_model()` in python, I noticed it leads to creating a folder present in the temp folder. I am working on a project which loads 4 MLModels whose size is 2.5GB each, and this results in filling up disk space very quickly. A suggestion would be deleting this folder as soon as the program stops running or providing an `argument` for changing the folder's directory where MLModels are loaded.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nI discovered this issue while debugging my project and noticed this is a problem if I deploy it somewhere. \r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nI feel many MLflow users will come with this issue if they are taking their projects to production.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support your project(s) or organization?\r\nOur organization is moving towards MLOps very quickly as it is a skill required for every software engineer interested in data science/AI-related work. MLFlow is an integral part of automating our ML projects; hence, we think this feature would benefit us and ML Engineers in general.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [x] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [x] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [x] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [x] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [x] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [x] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [x] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [x] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages (Python)\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [x] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [x] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.

For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ X] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**: no\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: linux\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: source\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**:   1.19.0\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker build -t mlflow-docker-example -f Dockerfile .\r\nmlflow run examples/docker -P alpha=0.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nThe example in `examples/docker` has become out of date and no longer runs. The base image (`miniconda:4.5.4`) in the dockerfile is pinned to Python 2.7, and several of the other python packages are also broken.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ docker build -t mlflow-docker-example -f Dockerfile .\r\nSending build context to Docker daemon  278.5kB\r\nStep 1/2 : FROM continuumio/miniconda:4.5.4\r\n4.5.4: Pulling from continuumio/miniconda\r\ncc1a78bfd46b: Pull complete\r\n420ea9ce27d9: Pull complete\r\n1b219c050547: Pull complete\r\n1c177edca126: Pull complete\r\nDigest: sha256:19d3eedab8b6301a0e1819476cfc50d53399881612183cf65208d7d43db99cd9\r\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for continuumio/miniconda:4.5.4\r\n ---> 16e4fbac86ce\r\n...\r\nRemoving intermediate container 977134a62fa9\r\n ---> 683df65a5751\r\nSuccessfully built 683df65a5751\r\nSuccessfully tagged mlflow-docker-example:latest\r\n\r\n$ mlflow run examples/docker -P alpha=0.5\r\n2021/09/20 21:30:59 INFO mlflow.projects.docker: === Building docker image docker-example:94891da ===\r\n2021/09/20 21:31:02 INFO mlflow.projects.utils: === Created directory /tmp/tmpnk6qb3_7 for downloading remote URIs passed to arguments of type 'path' ===\r\n2021/09/20 21:31:02 INFO mlflow.projects.backend.local: === Running command 'docker run --rm -v /home/osdi-eval/mlflow/mlruns:/mlflow/tmp/mlruns -v /home/osdi-eval/mlflow/mlruns/0/1db9353955c74803bbe8f9f2245070b3/artifacts:/home/osdi-eval/mlflow/mlruns/0/1db9353955c74803bbe8f9f2245070b3/artifacts -e MLFLOW_RUN_ID=1db9353955c74803bbe8f9f2245070b3 -e MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=file:///mlflow/tmp/mlruns -e MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_ID=0 docker-example:94891da python train.py --alpha 0.5 --l1-ratio 0.1' in run with ID '1db9353955c74803bbe8f9f2245070b3' ===\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"train.py\", line 16, in <module>\r\n    import mlflow\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mlflow/__init__.py\", line 31, in <module>\r\n    import mlflow.tracking._model_registry.fluent\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/__init__.py\", line 8, in <module>\r\n    from mlflow.tracking.client import MlflowClient\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mlflow/tracking/client.py\", line 8, in <module>\r\n    from mlflow.entities import ViewType\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mlflow/entities/__init__.py\", line 6, in <module>\r\n    from mlflow.entities.experiment import Experiment\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mlflow/entities/experiment.py\", line 2, in <module>\r\n    from mlflow.entities.experiment_tag import ExperimentTag\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mlflow/entities/experiment_tag.py\", line 2, in <module>\r\n    from mlflow.protos.service_pb2 import ExperimentTag as ProtoExperimentTag\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mlflow/protos/service_pb2.py\", line 7, in <module>\r\n    from google.protobuf import descriptor as _descriptor\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/google/protobuf/descriptor.py\", line 113\r\n    class DescriptorBase(metaclass=DescriptorMetaclass):\r\n                                  ^\r\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\r\n2021/09/20 21:31:03 ERROR mlflow.cli: === Run (ID '1db9353955c74803bbe8f9f2245070b3') failed ===\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.

That leads to code like this where the user needs to format a `runs:/` URL to be able to register the model, which is pretty user-unfriendly. Ideally, model registration would also not require special-casing `file:` during local runs.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\nimport mlflow.sklearn\r\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes\r\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Ridge\r\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\r\n\r\n# Setup MLFlow tracking\r\nmlflow.sklearn.autolog()\r\n\r\n# Load data\r\nX, y = load_diabetes(return_X_y = True)\r\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)\r\n\r\nwith mlflow.start_run() as run:\r\n    # Train model\r\n    model = Ridge(alpha=0.03)\r\n    model.fit(X_train, y_train)\r\n\r\n    # Test model\r\n    mse = mean_squared_error(model.predict(X_test), y_test)\r\n    mlflow.log_metric(\"test_mse\", mse)\r\n\r\n    # Register model\r\n    if not(mlflow.get_tracking_uri().startswith('file:')):\r\n        mlflow.register_model(f\"runs:/{run.info.run_id}/model\", \"my_model\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\n\r\nSimplify model registration.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n\r\nThis creates a barrier to entry for new users: I had to spend quite some time figuring out the right string-format incantation.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n\r\nI am trying to evangelize more rigorous MLOps processes and extra complexity reduces appeal.\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\n\r\nString formatting is very low level and leads to typos difficult to debug.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nImplementation-wise, one possibility would be for `mlflow.register_model()` to accept a `run` object as input, or for `autolog()` to give an option to register models.\r\n\r\nNote sure how to deal with the `file:` special-case. Maybe log instead of failing (or implement model registration in `file:` but that's likely larger work). ",

    "body": "## MLflow Roadmap Item\r\n\r\nThis is an MLflow Roadmap item that has been prioritized by the MLflow maintainers. We're seeking help with the implementation of roadmap items tagged with the `help wanted` label.\r\n\r\nFor requirements clarifications and implementation questions, or to request a PR review, please tag @BenWilson2 in your communications related to this issue.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nInclude model signature and input example information with MLflow Models that are logged during autologging. This functionality is currently only present in a few autologging integrations: [mlflow.xgboost.autolog()](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/94891da1c272038ac506f5d091c8c6b19e009b2d/mlflow/xgboost.py#L662-L664), [mlflow.lightgbm.autolog()](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/94891da1c272038ac506f5d091c8c6b19e009b2d/mlflow/lightgbm.py#L553-L555), and [mlflow.sklearn.autolog()](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/94891da1c272038ac506f5d091c8c6b19e009b2d/mlflow/sklearn/__init__.py#L1227-L1229), but there are many other integrations listed here - https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#automatic-logging - that do not have this functionality.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? Model signatures and input examples make it easier to incorporate ML models into inference workflows.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? ^\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? ^\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? Users must currently compute signatures / input examples manually and invoke `mlflow.*.log_model()` to record this information with a persisted MLflow Model. This complicates the autologging experience.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations",

    "body": "## MLflow Roadmap Item\r\n\r\nThis is an MLflow Roadmap item that has been prioritized by the MLflow maintainers. We're seeking help with the implementation of roadmap items tagged with the `help wanted` label.\r\n\r\nFor requirements clarifications and implementation questions, or to request a PR review, please tag @sunishsheth2009 in your communications related to this issue.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nIntroduce support for sorting the Runs table in the MLflow Experiment UI by multiple columns at once. Users should be able to select and deselect columns for sorting and sorting them in both ascending and descending order.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? Multiple metrics and parameters are often important to determining a model's configuration and performance characteristics. It can be difficult to identify optimal run(s) via the experiment UI when runs table sorting is only allowed on a single column.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? Many MLflow users leverage the experiment UI / runs table to identify good candidate runs.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? Many Databricks users leverage the experiment UI / runs table to identify good candidate runs.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? Users must currently use the MLflow API to sort runs on multiple metrics, parameters, etc simultaneously; this is not offered in the UI.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [X] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n",

    "body": "## MLflow Roadmap Item\r\n\r\nThis is an MLflow Roadmap item that has been prioritized by the MLflow maintainers. \r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nThe Keras framework is now embedded in the TensorFlow namespace; i.e. it is recommended that users refer to `tf.keras` when building Keras models. Currently, the `mlflow.tensorflow` model flavor does not provide a friendly interface for saving `tf.keras` models in MLflow format, and the inference input / output format for pyfunc representations of `tf.keras` models is also difficult to use. Finally, users often experience confusion about which module to use with Keras models in MLflow: `mlflow.keras` or `mlflow.tensorflow`. \r\n\r\nWe propose that:\r\n\r\n1. Users should be able to save tf.keras models in SavedModel format via the `mlflow.tensorflow.log_model` and `mlflow.tensorflow.save_model` APIs.\r\n\r\n2. The pyfunc representation of a tf.keras model should use the same input / output interface that is currently in place for models saved from the `mlflow.keras` module.\r\n\r\n3. The `mlflow.keras` module should be deprecated in favor of the `mlflow.tensorflow` module.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? Unifying the tf.Keras model experience in MLflow and removing model persistence and inference format pitfalls will improve the usability of this part of the platform.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? Many MLflow users leverage tf.keras for model development.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? Many Databricks users leverage tf.keras for model development.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? There is no clear guidance for which module to use when saving / deploying tf.keras models in MLflow. `mlflow.keras` and `mlflow.tensorflow` behave differently.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [X] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n",

I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [X] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**:\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**:\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**:\r\n- **Python version**:\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**:\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior is that `mlflow.sklearn.eval_and_log_metrics` returns binary evaluation metrics for binary data when using default `pos_label` of 1.  This would be consistent with sklearn.metrics and align with the normal expectation when using binary data.  The actual behavior is that multi-class evaluation metrics are returned.  This is due to using `method='weighted'` instead of `method='binary'` in mlflow.utils._get_classifier_metrics, even when performing binary classification.  \r\n\r\nThis leads to misleading output, especially for imbalanced data.  If the positive class is a small fraction of the total, a naive predictor that classifies to the negative class will have precision, recall and F1 score near 1.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport mlflow\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport sklearn\r\n\r\nmodel = sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression()\r\nX = pd.DataFrame({'x': [0] * 100})\r\ny = [0] * 99 + [1]\r\n\r\n# Model can't predict the single 1 so binary classifiers are all 0.\r\n# This is reasonable as this classifier can't detect the positive class at all.\r\nmodel.fit(X, y)\r\nprint(sklearn.metrics.precision_score(y, model.predict(X)))\r\n# 0.0\r\nprint(sklearn.metrics.recall_score(y, model.predict(X)))\r\n# 0.0\r\nprint(sklearn.metrics.f1_score(y, model.predict(X)))\r\n# 0.0\r\n\r\n# But mlflow  precision, recall, and F1 score are all near 1.\r\nmlflow.sklearn.eval_and_log_metrics(model, X, y, prefix='train_')\r\n# {'train_precision_score': 0.9801000000000001,\r\n# 'train_recall_score': 0.99,\r\n# 'train_f1_score': 0.9850251256281406,\r\n# 'train_accuracy_score': 0.99,\r\n# 'train_log_loss': 0.04641982852065066,\r\n# 'train_roc_auc_score': 1.0}\r\n```\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback.

After I switched to version 1.20.2, I started having this problem.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, after tearDown removes the sqlite db after first case which have been, and setUp re-creates the database, following error occurs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMyTests::test_case_3 Failed: [undefined]mlflow.exceptions.MlflowException: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such table: experiments\r\n[SQL: SELECT experiments.experiment_id AS experiments_experiment_id, experiments.name AS experiments_name, experiments.artifact_location AS experiments_artifact_location, experiments.lifecycle_stage AS experiments_lifecycle_stage \r\nFROM experiments \r\nWHERE experiments.name = ?

I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nThe current view for comparing model versions shows parameters and metrics, but doesn't have a section to compare tags. Could we add a section which shows tags from the training run?\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nWe're currently storing some information in tags that would be useful to have as context when comparing across model versions. Given that the UI already allows you to compare metrics and parameters, it seems like we should also support comparing tags. We like to keep parameters more focused on data like hyperparameters, but there's additional run metadata that we log as tags. I imagine other teams similarly find it useful to add extra context to model runs through tags, and we should allow visibility of this context from the compare view.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [x] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nWe'd have to extend `CompareModelVersionsView.js` to include a component which compares tags across model versions.

I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\nI'm comfortable making the backend changes but may need assistance for UI updates.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nThe model registry currently offers a \"compare\" view across registered versions which is very helpful. However, it is most helpful if we only want to have a detailed comparison for the few latest registered model versions. I would like the ability to **view the evolution of a metric (e.g. model accuracy) over the lineage of a registered model**. Ideally, we can select a single metric of interest and plot this metric value on the y axis with the model version on the x-axis.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nFor a given registered model, I want to have visibility on how the model behavior is changing over time as we ship and deploy new versions. Do we see a dip in accuracy for the latest stage model that should be reviewed before promoting the model stage to production? Is there a long term trend for a given metric of interest? It's hard to have this sort of visibility from the UI currently.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [x] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n- The compare view becomes awkward to use when we've selected 10+ model versions. It may be useful to add a new component to the `/models/registered_model_name` page which is focused on plotting metrics over all versions.\r\n- The user should be able to select a metric and plot using either (1) model version or (2) training run timestamp for the x axis.\r\n- Model versions which don't have a value for the selected metric should be transparently excluded from the plot.\r\n- [optional] It would be nice to color (and toggle visibility for) model versions based on their stage.",

Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nSometimes, it would be handy to deactivate the autologging functionality temporarily. Like this\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nmlflow.sklearn.autolog() \r\n# do stuff\r\n\r\nwith mlflow.sklearn.autolog(disable = True):\r\n    # fit a null model or \r\n    # do a sklearn transformation not related to the main model\r\n    # ect.\r\n```\r\nUnfortunately, this gives an error. Of course, the workaround is to manually manage the context, but it's brittle and requires more boilerplate code.\r\n```python\r\nimport mlflow\r\n\r\nmlflow.sklearn.autolog() \r\n# do stuff\r\n\r\nmlflow.sklearn.autolog(disable = True)\r\n# fit a null model or \r\n# do a sklearn transformation not related to the main model\r\n# ect.\r\n\r\nmlflow.sklearn.autolog() \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? Boiler plate reduction and cognitive burden reduction.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? More code, remember parameters set before etc.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.
